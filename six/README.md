Junana.com was launched simultaneously in the USA, most of Europe, Korea, Japan, and China. Within a year, Junana was adding new users at the rate of five million a day on top of a 300 million user base. Fortune put a market value for Junana at ten billion dollars, and speculated serially on the sale of this to Apple, Sony, Google, and Microsoft. Apparently, only the Vatican was not interested.

Jennifer Bouchez at first resisted Claire’s order that pulled her from the Paris desk of Consolidated|International to report on Junana.com. Moving from the Champs Élysées to cyber-nowhere sounded like a bad career move. After a week she realized that Claire was right to put someone in charge of Junana, and that that someone should be her. After two hours she had more to report back to Con|Int than she could gather in a month on the Boulevard Saint Germain. She asked for a staff of five to keep up with the growing number of scenes. Claire gave her two, but let her pick them.

The hardest part for Jennifer was getting into Junana.com. To do so meant revealing aspects of her private life she usually kept to herself. Once her profile was accepted, she began to appreciate that Junana had achieved something special. The bullshit quotient was very low on Junana.

Other social spaces on the Internet had become more and more populated by corporate interests and borderline personality types who chose to hide behind a tapestry of intricate lies. These were people who could never accept what they would need to reveal about themselves in order to get into Junana.

Jennifer assembled her avatar image using a 3D photo booth at the Gare du Nord. In the first week, her avatar had more intimate conversations with total strangers than she would have in a year at any café in Paris. Of course, this might also have been due to Jennifer’s stunning appearance.

At the university, her physical beauty was much more of a burden than a blessing. People assumed she was sleeping with her advisors, most of whom had the same idea. She even tried inventing a husband out of town, returning from summer break with a wedding ring she bought in Venice. But that only seemed to increase the efforts of department faculty, who were invariably more engorged than engaged when around her.

On Junana, Jennifer had actually blurred her avatar’s face slightly, as though it had been poorly scanned. Old friends she met advised her to get rescanned. Rather, she enjoyed becoming more or less commonplace in her appearance, and felt emboldened to approach the strangers she met. She had dressed in a baggy hooded sweatshirt and loose jeans for the scan, and could have been ten years older or younger by the result. Jennifer was one of the few “reverse Pradabees” on the planet, who found comfort in being able to walk into a scene without creating one.

While Junana grew at a fantastic pace, it also spun its own cultural capital. Internet cafes from Hue and Djibouti City became doorways for locals to enter a global cafe on Junana, and windows for the cosmopolitans to converse with this global digital diaspora. The simultaneous language translations made possible conversations between Parisian scene kids and Bantu teenagers in Bulawayo. Users gathered friends, shared confidences and music, created places from the spaces afforded by the software, and brought with them the local scenes of a thousand towns and cities. Jennifer had no idea where this technology was headed, but she was certain the destination would be significant.

Game Release + Seven Months

Cindy stood with her hands on her hips.

“Way to go, Cowboy! By now, you’ve learned to do the brainwave exercises, so you won’t need Wanda and Jorge anymore. Wanda asked me if you would like that kiss?”

“Who? What?”

“Wanda. She wants to kiss you.”

The screen changed to just Cindy in the foreground in a room with low light. From the shadows behind her a figure appeared, and what a figure. It was Wanda, still wearing only the bottom of her bikini. Her hair cascaded over her shoulders and snaked down beside her breasts. Her eyes and her smile hit him like a spotlight. She walked right up beside Cindy.

“Is that him?” she asked.

“Pretty cute, eh?” Cindy said. “Nicky, meet Wanda.”

“Hi, Nick! This is for you.” She closed her eyes and leaned forward into a luxuriant puckering kiss. Nick unconsciously puckered his own lips.

“Tchau, Nick!” Wanda straightened out and waved both her hands. “Don’t forget to do the exercises every day. And mind Cindy!” She turned and sauntered back into the shadows.

“Just in case you were wondering, Wanda has kissed more than fifty thousand players today,” Cindy said.

“How many have you guided today?” He snapped.

“Only you, Nick. I’m here for you alone.” She frowned. “I thought you knew that.”

“Oh.” Nick slumped in his chair.

“I see you need some time to work this out. Why don’t you log off and go down to Butterfly Beach. There’s a four foot swell this afternoon.”

“Hmmm?” He looked back at her, lost in the intersections between this digital image and the conversation they were having.

“Bye, Nick. I’ll catch you later. I’ll be waiting for you. We’ve got hours and hours to go to get through this level. So go find some exercise, some dinner, and some sleep tonight; and come back tomorrow when you’re ready to rock!” She winked at him, and then the program quit.

“Woa!” Nick stared at his desktop and then, as if half asleep, put on his board shorts and headed out the door.

“You convinced?” Winston’s voice said on the speakerphone three days later. “It’s not there, I mean. There’s only a hint of what this can do. But still, I can’t stop playing....”

“I just spent three days reviewing everything I learned at college,” Jack said, “Remarkable!”

“So we’re on track?” Winston said.

“We don’t know where we’re going...” Itchy said,

“...but we’re on our way,” Scratchy concluded.

“Well, we’re going to need help,” Desi noted. “I know the templates are efficient, but the three of us will also be managing this circus. We’ve been taking turns on Admin for Junana, and it’s too much. I mean, really!”

“And we gotta eat, too,” Scratchy said. “I’ve lost ten pounds.” He patted his belly, bulging under a green hemp t-shirt.

“We could tap into the talent pool in Bangalore,” Desi said, “But I wouldn’t count on secrecy.”

Jack leaned back, suppressing a smile.

Desi stood and came around behind him. Leaning down, he began to massage Jack’s shoulders. “I’m betting our problem’s been solved already,” he announced.

They all turned to Jack, who seemed to be enjoying Desi’s ministrations.

“There’s this abandoned village between Hoi An and Danang,” Jack started. “About two hundred hectares along the Thu Bon River, it was flattened by an enormous artillery barrage in the war. The Americans said it housed a Vietcong company. Three years ago, Red Star Coffee purchased a ninety-nine-year lease on the land, and renamed it Sao Do. We already constructed a facility for five hundred workers and their families and support staff. Complete housing, a school for the kids, soccer fields, a movie house, restaurants, organic gardens, all fully contained.”

“What’s the programmer pool look like in Vietnam?” Winston asked.

“We’ll offer a ten year package that few Vietnamese companies would match. That will give us the cream of the crop.”

“But can they type?” Scratchy asked the question he always used whenever he was presented with a ten-page resume that sounded far too good to be true. Three years, he thought. That was well before their Hoi An Nerdfest. Winston was right, no slack about the Jack.

“They will be among the best and brightest, the hungriest of a very ambitious nation,” Jack replied.

Winston said, “Do they have the infrastructure we need?”

“We have only an OC-12 bandwidth uplink through a satellite,” Jack said. “Anything more would be suspicious. So we can’t serve any content from Sao Do.”

“We can serve content from anywhere,” Scratchy noted. “How do we supervise this operation?”

“I was hoping that Desikacharya could take charge in Hoi An.”

“I don’t mind,” Desi said. “Like I said, Bangalore is just one enormous geek reality show. And the waiters in Hoi An. Oh, my God!”

Game Release + Eight Months

After Bobby allowed her to kiss Jorge he sulked for a whole week. She would ask him what was bothering him and all he said was, “You know,” and then gallop away on Shadow.

“I know what?” By now she was riding Marmalade on her own, her avatar’s balance and the horse’s movement sensitive to her every keystroke. She pushed the horse faster and pulled up beside him.

“This is stupid,” she yelled, “Everybody kisses Jorge. It means nothing.”

He reigned in Shadow and they slowed to a walk along a cliff top, with a wild sea crashing onto the rocks below. “I am only your Guide. Soon you will earn your shoes, but I must remain barefoot. At some point you will go on without me.”

“You’re a very good Guide. You got me through Level One. Now we are deep into Level Two. You said I’m making real progress. And I would never leave you. Never!”

“But would you ever want to kiss me?”

“If you were here in my room, I’d do more than that, I’m afraid,” she blurted and then giggled.

“Have you read Jane Austen?” he said.

“Reading is not my strongest talent,” she said.

“It will be soon,” he offered. “I can show you how to read Sense and Sensibility in 30 minutes.”

“Only if you give me one of your really big smiles.” And he did.

Franklin Benjamin sat in his Tyson’s Corner high-rise office and looked over the Virginia sprawl to the District, where the Washington Monument was bathed in sunlight. He set down the phone, pushed back the lunch tray, and sipped his fifth cup of coffee. His latest client, another loon on the loose inside the beltway, had just agreed to a major increase in the billing.

Franklin had left his sub-cabinet level appointment in the Department of Education to pursue more lucrative options. Not quite State or Defense, but still good enough for a seat on the gravy train. Still, his clients were restless. They had little idea how government actually worked and had filled this intellectual void with the most outrageous fantasies, only a few of which Franklin could not deliver to them, given enough cash.

One of his former clients started a company packaging weather information from government satellites. To his horror, the fellow had discovered his was not the first organization in the world to do this. He wanted Franklin to get Congress to abolish the National Weather Service.

“You don’t like the Weather Service?”

“They give information out for free. How on earth am I supposed to compete with that?”

“But taxpayers paid for the satellites and the data archives. They might figure they should get something back.”

“Yeah, well they’ve been wrong before.”

Franklin then explained that the National Weather Service served an enormous public good, had done so for decades, and was among the best value-added services provided by the federal government. The client took in this information, thought for a minute, and then tripled his contract.

Franklin found a senator who needed immediate campaign -finance help and talked him into endorsing this idea. Clearly, this was another example of “big government” holding back the marketplace. Besides, anyone who wasn’t willing to pay to know where the next storm would strike could just as well crawl up in their attic with an axe and wait for it.

The senator’s amendment abolishing the National Weather Service was narrowly defeated and then only because another senator, working with a different lobbyist, had attached a separate amendment, a little bill that would have made coastal whale hunting both legal and, under certain circumstances, fully subsidized. Despite the avalanche of protests from a wide range of environmental groups, Democrats, and foreign governments, the bill actually got though its subcommittee. President Stone was on record as “looking forward to kicking some whale tail,” the next time he was on the coast.

Senators from landlocked states objected to the notion of subsidies and shot down the whale amendment and with it all the other amendments to the bill, which died in a conference committee. Franklin told his client to wait another year, but the jerk’s investors had already pulled their backing.

Franklin’s new client wanted the government to shut down Junana.com, a social networking Internet site. Shut it down immediately, he demanded.

“We don’t know who they are. They could be anyone. Terrorists. Liberals, for chrissake!”

“Let me look into it,” Franklin promised.

Franklin’s research was remarkably unproductive. But then, Junana.com was owned and managed by a private offshore company, and so it made no annual or quarterly reports. They leased space on server farms across the planet and hired workers, mostly for customer service, in several countries. They paid their taxes and followed all the rules for Internet commerce. Still, they did not allow advertising and had no apparent means of generating income.

The Street did not find this odd and considered it a gambit to build the customer base and name value. And with the enormous interest in the service, the mavens approved entirely. Everyone was waiting for an IPO or some offer to sell.

Franklin signed himself up for a Junana.com account. He gave himself the name “Buddy Duncan” and pretty much lied about everything else. He was required to give a real email to verify, and when the page refreshed he was confronted with the following message.

“Dear ‘Buddy’:

Or, shall we say, ‘Franklin.’ While we understand you might have personal reasons to disguise who you are, we do request that you leave these reasons in your desk and do not bring them to Junana.com. Junana.com is a social service based on mutual trust and civil behavior. You can a) correct the information you provided; b) decide you are not really ready to join Junana.com; or, c) press the button below to allow Junana.com to help you remember just who you are.

Thank you,

Junana.com”

“Wow!” Franklin exclaimed, and pushed the button.

The form he had just filled out appeared again, only this time it showed his real name and home and office addresses, and also his real age, height, hair and eye color, marital status, educational and residential background, even his book, music, and movie preferences.

He scrolled down the page. There were a dozen photographs of him, including close-ups from several group shots. How did they know about Emerson, Lake, and Palmer? Who were these people? All this information from a simple email address. He knew it was theoretically possible, but he thought nobody but the NSA had done it. What if Junana.com was the NSA? How better to gather information than to just ask a billion people to voluntarily submit this, just so they can chat with their friends?

He filled in the password field and pushed the “Submit” button. Immediately he got an email to verify his information, which he did. He logged in and clicked around for a while before he took a phone call and spent the rest of the afternoon babysitting the chief of staff of a congressman from Alabama. He was firing off an email when he heard a tune playing in the background. It was Emerson, Lake & Palmer, some live version of Karn Evil 9 he had never heard before.

A chat box appeared, and he remembered he was still logged into Junana.com. “I thought you might like this,” it said. Underneath was a photo of a fifty-something woman, a name, Elsa Urlich, and a city, Buenos Aires. He right-clicked on the MP3 file and it asked him if he wanted to save it to his collection, so he did that. He thanked Elsa on the chat box, clicked on her name, scanned her bio, discovered that she had lived in Atlanta the same years he had, and then logged off. He sat back and looked out the window, over to the District. The sun was just setting. Junana.com had impressed him enormously. He’d never found an Internet service that integrated information, communication, and convenience so effortlessly.

He then returned to his research. Junana.com did not publish its user statistics, but the rumors were huge. He had to admit that knowing he could verify Elsa’s life story was profoundly stimulating.

He logged in again and the user interface asked if he wanted to continue on the same path as the last visit. He pushed “yes” and got Elsa’s page. He noticed that her biography was much longer than his, and filled with information about her tastes and dreams, about what she was looking for and offering to a relationship.

Looking at Elsa’s profile he liked what he saw. He opened the chat to her and told her how much he enjoyed the Emerson, Lake, and Palmer song. She responded, “Thanks. Who are you?”

He typed. “Can’t you see my profile?”

She typed. “That’s just the form they give you to join. Who are you?”

He typed. “I just joined today. Give me time.”

She typed. “I’ll check back tomorrow. Have a good evening.”

He typed. “You too,” and ended the chat.

He looked at his bio. Most of the form was blank. The questions were embarrassing to even read. How was he to fill any of these out?

Three hours and four Crown Royals later he had cobbled together a selection of interests and accomplishments that showcased his strengths, revealing several sensitivities and a couple minor faults. His love for dogs, for example, was balanced by a passion for fast cars. He characterized himself as “slow to anger” but also “quick with a smile.” He was looking for a partner who could “enjoy simple pleasures,” a walk on the beach, pushing a child on a swing, crap like that. His politics were “moderate” but he confessed a penchant for “personal liberty.” He figured the overall effect would attract someone who could service his needs without making too many wild demands.

He was working on refining the tone of his prior accomplishments when the whole form was suddenly framed in red and the words “SINCERITY ALERT” appeared at the top. A pop-up window displayed the following text:

“Junana.com has been monitoring this page, and comparing its contents with known information about the user and studies of other users who have attempted to mislead by faking their own biographies. For information on how to correct this matter please press the button below."

“Fuck me,” he whispered and set down his drink. He moused over and pushed the button. Another memo appeared on a pop-up window:

“Dear Franklin,

Or shall we call you ‘Frank,’ which you generally prefer? Although we realize that honesty may not be your strongest suit, and while we might appreciate the scope of your imagination, the information you have provided is so completely full of shit that we cannot allow this to be posted without some warning for the general public. It is widely known, for example, that your politics are emphatically ‘immoderate’.

Several persons from your past were invited to suggest key attributes of your personality when you signed up recently. The most charitable of these suggestions were “soul-sucking narcissist” and “self-serving ball-licker.” Neither of these qualities appears in the form that you filled out.

While you might have made your share of mistakes in the past that you now feel do not represent your current outlook, your friends signaled that you are incapable of either self reflection or intimacy of any sort. This suggests that the very task of filling out the form might be extremely difficult or even frightening to you.

Frank, you are not alone. Millions of Junana.com users have struggled with the same problem. At this moment, globally, approximately forty-two million pages remain in Sincerity Alert status. And in your region, almost twenty-five percent of users find themselves in this situation. Frank, if it’s any comfort, you are surrounded by assholes just like yourself.

Junana.com has placed this page on a Sincerity Alert. This means that a random selection of people from your past will be tasked to approve the contents of your bio form. Alternatively, you can push the button below and select three individuals that you would trust to do this service.

Sincerely,

Junana.com"

“Excellent.” Franklin pushed the button and a page appeared. It was formatted like a search result with the names of people in bold, photos on the right, and some lines of text below each name described their connection to Frank. There was a menu on top that allowed the names to be resorted by date, place, or level of intimacy. Another choice allowed a filter to open up the range of personal contacts, and a search box was provided. Next to each name was a check box. All he had to do was pick three of his buddies to back him up.

The default sort was temporal, latest first. He scrolled through a broad selection of people he worked around, lived near, golfed with, or who provided services he used. As he scrolled down, it was like running his life in reverse, back through the “Stone Age” as the liberal press called the current administration, to his work as a senior staff member for the junior senator from Virginia, his stint at the Independence Center think tank, the years in Atlanta shilling for that congressman, and his time as a student at Georgetown. His wife showed up together with her witches’ coven of friends. But where were Walt Egan, Bernie Simpson, or Sam Reynolds? Freddy Owen, Luke Broadhurst, and the gang from the local Republicans for Fairness crowd?

All the names on the list and photographs were vaguely familiar to him, some even painfully familiar. It seemed that every woman he had taken out in the last ten years was on the list. No wonder he was getting the shaft.

He didn’t see anybody he could rely upon to cover for him. He counted nineteen people he had fired, six he had out-positioned for promotion, and maybe a dozen he knew for a fact hated his guts. This was not going to be easy. He began to consider that his client was right, that this was some liberal conspiracy. But then he searched for “conservative” and pulled up twenty-five people who were far more to the right than he ever was. This included Tim Crane, who ran the Independence Center.

He clicked on Tim’s photograph and Tim’s home page popped up. Looking at the biography, he remembered how much he admired and despised the man. Tim talked with Frank only once, and Frank had been careful not to rock the boat. But after that, Tim never acknowledged that Frank even existed, although Frank took many occasions to bring up this conversation with Tim when he was around other Republicans for Fairness.

Rereading the bio, Frank learned that Tim was an avid birdwatcher and something of a home-improvement nerd. Tim taught soccer in the youth league and missed his father. He longed for respect as an intellectual, loved being a grandfather, and felt that his work was mostly misunderstood.

“What a dork!” Frank spoke to his laptop. But then Tim was there on Junana.com and Frank still needed three people to back up his claims. After an hour, he had found only one person, his mailman, who might not fuck him over. He had considered the idea of giving the mailman a Christmas tip, and he vowed that next year there’d be a five-dollar bill and a card. But he needed two more names and nothing was happening. He wondered if the mailman had a lot of friends.

He had finished most of the bottle of Crown Royal. When he looked out the window, the darkness was filigreed by the lights of the District. His anger began to boil with his hunger. He had skipped dinner to put this bio-form together and now all his efforts mocked him. In a rage he erased all of his entries.

He shut down his computer and stood next to the window. A shadow of humiliation darkened his face in his reflection off the glass. Well-meaning jerks like Tim Crane could afford to be honest only because people like him did all the heavy lifting in the trenches. He had only done what anyone would do in his position.

Who gave Junana.com the right to sit in judgment over his life? Who were these guys? He made a promise to himself to do whatever it took to bring down this so-called service, uncover the pricks who ran it, and make them wish they’d never seen a computer.
