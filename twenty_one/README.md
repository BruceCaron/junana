# Twenty One
Reverend Chad Stedman had been running the UCCC morning Prayer Hour radio show for over two decades, first from a broadcast shack outside of San Antonio, and more recently from the national radio broadcast center near Oklahoma City. Although the audience now exceeded millions, the format remained the same: some topical conversation to remind the listeners about the sorry state of the nation, one or two guest celebrities—mainly authors with books to tout—one or more crisis cases, an impending heart transplant, say, or a really nasty brain tumor victim, then the mention of certain individuals who had requested a special prayer, and finally the call-in segment.

Every few minutes Chad would lead the listening audience in a short prayer and an announcement of the 800 number where listeners could donate to the cause. Regular donors found their way into the special prayer queue. The Prayer Hour ran from 10 to 11 a.m. Oklahoma time every Sunday morning, just before the national UCCC televised service.

Five minutes before broadcast, while Chad was skimming the list of regional calamities—a tornado in Texas, a toxic train wreck in South Carolina, a triple murder in Spokane—Ernie, the producer, cracked open the door to the booth and stuck his head in.

“Bishop’s going to be the guest today. Just got the call.” He pointed his finger at the clock. “10:40 sharp. Get them ready.”

Reverend Gerry Bishop had been a regular guest on the Prayer Hour until the Orange County cathedral was finished. Now he was a television star and never paid the radio program much attention, even though it was the radio revenue that built his cathedral. The Prayer Hour still pulled in twice the audience of the TV broadcast, but Chad couldn’t even get Gerry to answer his phone calls. Now he wanted Chad to talk up his guest call-in so the audience numbers would be spectacular. At times like this, he wished he were back preaching in his little church in Hondo, Texas, where Gerry found him.

Every year for the past seven years Claire had gathered the Con|Int posse for a retreat at the Abbot’s Abode, a lodge between Santa Fe and Taos. This offered a bracing combination of glorious scenery, pure mountain air, a full spa, a string of horses, and an excellent restaurant. Nearby Bandelier National Monument provided long walks through the ruins of an ancient Anasazi settlement. Claire would reserve the Old House, a five-bedroom adobe on the crest of the hill away from the main lodge. For four days they would work out the kinks in their operation, review their performance from the previous year and set priorities for the next. They normally met in early October, before the snows arrived but after the back-to-school season and Claire’s report to the RIND Corporation.

This year their gathering was delayed by the ongoing marketplace fiasco. Claire managed to secure the Old House for a week in mid March, knowing that this was likely their last visit. Most of the staff had been furloughed, and the Posse was working on half salary, except for Betsy, who was still running statistics full time.

Jennifer had assigned Roland and Annika as data feeds for Betsy. Annika moved to New Orleans and was camped out in the old servants’ quarters behind Betsy’s main house. Roland stayed in London and collaborated through Junana. Betsy would request data runs, and Annika would return these from Junana as tabular records. Although Junana returned its raw data in minutes, some of Betsy’s statistical regression runs took days. Annika’s Norse athlete looks made a splash in the local lesbian scene, but nobody moved in on Betsy. Betsy was the queen of the Forbidden Desire Krewe. Annika sometimes wore her yellow blouse and always carried her blue shoulder bag.

Betsy had no time for the Game, she protested. Not with the real world getting so incredibly interesting, statistically speaking. She wished she had more computing power, but hesitated to bring this up with Claire. Con|Int was running on its contingency funds already. Betsy had asked for a half-time salary. Claire emailed back that she wanted Betsy on this project full time. Betsy was reviewing the retail catastrophe that was the Christmas shopping season when Claire called.

“Interesting, you say?” Claire asked.

“Like you would not believe,” Betsy responded. Her office was in the attic of her Garden District house. “For example, huge numbers of people, Gamers, I suspect, are either lying to or just playing with the pollsters. Sure, you could always count on a third of the American population to believe in just about anything, from UFOs to leprechauns. A third would believe that the federal government was a conspiracy run by global banking interests, and a third would be solidly behind the president; I always suspected these were the same people. But they were still sincere. You can test for consistency and sincerity inside your survey.

“Right now people are actively spoofing the process. I keep up with the main pollster listserves, and the trends have them running scared. If this keeps up, public opinion polls will soon be obsolete. The sample size required to generate good numbers will approach a large percentage of the population. You might as well just run an election to see what deodorant people use. Problem is, I don’t know if we can even hold elections unless the population is convinced their opinions are respected.”

“So democracy is under attack.”

“Hell no! Democracy is in flower. Voting is probably the least democratic action you do over the course of a year. Democracy is not about voting, it is about disagreements and conversation. Democracy is the long argument we have among ourselves, agreeing not to take this to the point of bloodshed. We vote for our proxies to carry on this conversation in Congress. If the population becomes disenchanted with the performance of their proxies, or the manner of their selection, then not-voting or gaming the vote are both extremely democratic alternatives.”

“How about fixing the process?”

“Maybe your Game has some goddamn template that will do that. You tell me.”

“It’s not my Game. I’m just another player.”

“Last three months it’s been your entire life, you hardly even answer your emails anymore. Claire, this thing will ruin Con|Int and every other opinion-based research operation. However, the Game is a statistical gold mine. Do you realize that a billion people have logged on worldwide? Do you know how accurate we can be with a sample size like that?”

“The Game doesn’t record the opinions of its players,” Claire noted.

“I can’t ask it how many people think W.G. Stone is the worst president ever, or if they brush with Crest,” Betsy replied. “What I can do is get a list of the templates in the Game and the number of players that have been exposed to these worldwide. I can do content analyses of the templates, try to map their scope and influence. I can even get a fine geographical distribution that allows me to build decision surfaces at the scale of census blocks.”

“What does that give you?”

“As an example, I’ve got a significant negative correlation between the spread of the Simple on the Outside template and the market for those sequined tops Con|Int predicted would do so well this fall.”

“What about Simplicity Loves Difference?” Claire asked. The power of simplicity is based on its implicit contrast with complexity. You can’t make everything simple.

“Apparently covering your top with sequins is not the right difference. There are multiple templates that inform how the design of objects is being evaluated. And difference seems to be only a very minor love for simplicity.”

“Or we’ve been immersing consumers in random difference for so long that simplicity may just appear to be its own difference.”

“Tell that to Evisu Jeans.”

“I did. Like you said, we might need to find a new line of work.”

“I’m so busy I’ll barely see Mardi Gras this year. I’m hoping to get a handle on the whole Game effect for our meeting in New Mexico. We might be able to pull a new rabbit out of this little black hat.”

“Betsy, you are the best!”

“Why, Claire, I didn’t think you noticed.” Betsy hung up. She looked out the window. Annika was doing some yoga exercises on the patio in the back yard. Betsy took a last bite of beignet from her breakfast tray and decided a little yoga might just be in order.

“Reverend Bishop, this is an honor!”

“Nonsense, Chad, your ministry is vital to our work, and I’ve been away far too long.”

“Still, it must be mighty important for you to take time away from preparing your Sunday sermon.”

“Important doesn’t even cover it. I’m here to ask everybody listening to join with me on my “Pull the Plug on Satan” crusade. I just read that our children are spending a hundred billion hours a year on that infernal Game. We’re fightin’ a war all across the nation, a battle against the pernicious, vile content that is pouring from our children’s computers and poisoning their minds.”

“Amen, Reverend,” Chad intoned.

“It’s going to take more than action, Chad. It’s time to bring in the heavy guns, unleash the power of prayer. I’m asking each and every one of our listeners to join with me and pray that our sons and daughters find protection against the Junanas of the world.”

“Amen!”

“Pray with me that God will smite them as he did the wicked Sodomites.”

“Dear God, listen to our prayers.”

“Strike down Junana, bring it low, crush it with your righteous anger.”

“And God, keep Reverend Bishop strong, in this time of consternation. May his crusade be your crusade, and may he lead us to the place of peace and comfort.”

“Why, thank you Reverend Stedman. And thank all of our listeners for their prayers.” Bishop hung up.

“Let’s say one more prayer, together, and remember, you can support the ‘Pull the Plug on Satan’ crusade with a contribution to the cause. That’s 800 Y-E-S UCCC. Operators are standing by to take your call.”

Being new, Megan worked weekends, which sucked. It was midday on a Sunday when the Game went down.

“Holy fuck!” A Gamer in the corner let out, shaking his laptop. Megan looked up from the Linea. Around the room Gamers were frantically working their computers.

“What’s up with the WiFi?” Someone asked.

“It’s not the WiFi,” another Gamer said. “The Game is down.”

“The Game is down?” The room filled with mutters and curses.

Megan and the other workers went and stood behind Howard, a regular with a MacBook Pro. The Junana client was running, but the screen just showed a Unix error message: ERROR 1119 SQLSTATE HY000 (ER_STACK_OVERRUN).

“Try restarting the client,” someone suggested. Howard did. Same message.

“Maybe it’s just bad here,” a faint cry of hopeful desperation. Several Gamers packed up and left.

“That’s idiotic,” Howard said. “This is a server-side problem, unexpected, I would guess, since they didn’t trap it well.”

“Shouldn’t we call someone?”

“I’m sure they already know.”

“Check the Internet, what’s up on Slash|Dash?”

The room went into a disordered crisis mode. Everybody with a computer browsed for information, shouting out bits of news from the Geek blogs. Even the basic Internet version of Junana was down. Nobody was ordering coffee.

Megan drifted to the window. The idea of going home and not logging in tugged at her. The street looked oddly cold and the buildings old and dirty.

“We’re down,” Scratchy said, surveying the console. “Across the board. Junana’s down, the Game is offline.”

“What happened?” Winston had just popped into the Room. He spied Desi, Itchy, and Scratchy hunched over their keyboards.

“They hit all our servers at once,” Scratchy said. “Not a software attack, they physically knocked us off the backbone. In Goleta they blew up the fiber conduit in two places, took out the University’s Ariadne link and cable TV for most of the county.”

“In Kyoto, they caused a fire in the subway tunnel under Karasuma-dori, fried the optical fiber and all of the telephone cables,” Itchy said.

“In Mysore, I heard they blasted the conduit from Banglore and took out the train track too,” Desi said.

“The stacks for the admin queues backed up and we had a cascade failure on the server,” Scratchy said. “We’ve been down almost three hours now.”

“I thought we had moved everything over to the mesh,” Winston said.

“We were in the process,” Itchy replied. “Still had a few vital admin functions to test.”

“But we are here.” Winston gestured around the Room.

“Remember, we took the Room out of Junana. This facility is running independently on the mesh, so it never went offline.” Desi said. “We have Console capability, too...”

“...which will probably save us,” Scratchy said. “Good thing we were hacked. And lucky the mesh didn’t go down.”

“That’s because you threaded the server on top of the mesh,” Desi said. “However did you do that?”

“Junana’s down, too” Winston mused. “So we can’t communicate with anyone. What about email?”

Itchy typed for a minute. “The email server is still running.”

“Why not send a blast message that Junana and the Game will be up in two days or so,” Winston said, “Keep them from panicking.”

“And tell them to keep their computers up and running,” Scratchy said, “Otherwise we’ll lose the mesh. Desi, you’re the Game’s Grand Poobah. Why don’t you send the message.”

“I’ve never emailed a billion people before,” Desi said. “Guess I’ll keep it short.” He typed for a while. Winston came up behind Scratchy, who was skipping from one administration screen to another.

“Look at that, we didn’t even trap the error. How embarrassing,” Scratchy mumbled.

“But you can reboot it,” Winston said quietly. He went to the empty console and began to search the Internet.

“Rebooting a mesh computer from the mesh has never been tried,” Scratchy reminded him. “It’s like repairing your parachute after you jump.”

“There are about twenty steps, and we have to take them one at a time,” Itchy said. “Some steps may take hours. We don’t know. We have a clean dump from the database about four hours before the system fried. With luck we can simply reload this.”

“There’s a televangelist who’s taking credit for knocking Junana off the Internet,” Winston read from the search result. “Says it was the ‘power of prayer’.”

“Prayer and a little C4,” Scratchy said, “Potent mix. What’s he got against Junana?”

Winston read some more. “He says we are leading his children away from God. Calls us instruments of the devil.”

“He’s right,” Scratchy said. “I’d say it’s pretty much him or us.”

“But we don’t have any religious agenda at all,” Itchy said.

“Zap!” Scratchy said. “We mix everything up: religion, society, and philosophy. The Queries move people to the intersections between all of these. Organized religions can only survive on their own terms, within their own boundaries. The Game erases these boundaries. Kid asks a question about God, next thing he knows he’s reading Genesis, the Bhagavad Gita, and the Abhidamma Pitaka. Like they all have something to say, which they do.”

“Ramen!” said Winston.

“Here’s my email,” Desi said. “‘Dear Junana users. Due to a number of unfortunate explosions we have temporarily gone offline. We hope to be back within a day or two. Please take this opportunity to go talk to someone. Ride a bicycle. Climb a tree. Keep your computer on and stand by. See you in the Game in a few days.’ I sign it ‘G.M.’”

“Fine,” Itchy said. “I’ll spool it through the email list at fifty-thousand emails a chunk. At five millisends seconds a chunk, that’ll take...”

“About an hour and a half,” Winston said.

Jack popped in. “Sorry, I was on a flight.”

“They took out our admin and content servers. Fifteen explosions in nine countries, all at the same time,” Scratchy said. “They also fried our old content server farms with some kind of electronic pulse to scramble their directories. None of our current content is on these servers, but we’d paid through the end of the month so they were still up. I get the feeling these people want us out of business.”

“Took out the servers? Then they don’t know about the mesh,” Jack said. “So our thief was probably working on his own and still hasn’t found a buyer. How soon can you release the code?”

“We’ve been extracting some of the peripheral database hacking routines,” Itchy said. “And beefing up the comments. Mikey spent a whole day doing a work-around for leap-years.”

“A whole day?” Desi said, his avatar’s eyebrows raised.

“Sometimes easy is hard,” Scratchy said.

“As soon as the game goes back online without any servers, they will know about the mesh computer,” Desi noted.

“Tuesday is Mardi Gras,” Scratchy said. “With luck, we can have the Game up again by then and release the code too.”

“How do you release the code?” Jack asked.

“Post it to SourceForge,” Itchy said.

“Under whose name?” Jack asked.

“Lionel Boyd Johnson?” Itchy offered.

“No pseudonyms allowed,” Desi said.

“Might as well put all three of your names on it. Desi and Itchy are safe in Sao Do,” Jack said.

“Neos all around!” Winston added.

Itchy said, “But what happens to Scratchy?”

“They already killed my cats. I’m living in a hotel suite and not answering my phone,” Scratchy reminded him.

“Tuesday, I’ll have my jet take Michael to Hawaii. He can camp out at the Kona Cove. I’ll pick him up in two weeks when I come by on the way to Sao Do. One more thing...” He walked around to face them.

“Someone with a global reach and not a lot of impulse control has just declared war on Junana. We have to assume they will not stop at property destruction. They’ve identified Ichiro and Desi as technical participants. Next, they will be looking for Winston and me, and for the source code.”

“Do we bring the admin servers back up?” Winston asked.

“No need,” Scratchy said. “We’ll be fully on the mesh.”

“So we can shut down our server operations,” Winston said.

“We’ll still be running the largest computer in the world,” Desi noted.

“There is that,” Jack said. “And we are the largest single shoe manufacturer on the planet.”

“And the biggest university,” Winston added. “We’re sending out more than a million diplomas a week.”

“Busy, busy, busy.” Itchy said.

“The faster we go, the rounder we get,” Scratchy said. “Let’s reboot this puppy.”

Essie was so very grateful that Randy was there when the Game failed. When she woke up, her Computo the screen just read: ERROR 1119 SQLSTATE HY000 (ER_STACK_OVERRUN). She restarted the device and got the same message. At first she thought that maybe the machine that moves across the heavens, the satellite, had stopped talking to her Computo. On her way to breakfast Randy came running up to her.

“The Game’s under attack,” he said, falling into stride beside her. “They bombed the servers. Junana’s down too.” He seemed almost happy.

“Who would do such a thing?” she asked him.

“There’s a lot of chatter on Slash|Dash. They’re all talking about religious extremists. Some nut in California predicted it. I got an email from the Grand Meister. He said they’d be back up in days.”

“Then you have no excuse not to go out to the tented camp with your family today. You might see a lion.”

“I might even see a cheetah!” he said and ran off toward the dining room.

Why would somebody attack the Game? she wondered. She contemplated something that had never occurred to her. She considered the prospect of living without the Game. She shivered as she walked, as though a ghost had passed through her.

Gerry Bishop clicked on an email from his son with the title “Why not kill me and get it over with.”

Father,

What have you done? You destroyed our Game. Why did you do this? How could you do this?

I’ve sent you a dozen emails telling you to just try the Game. Just once, that’s all I asked.

Now it is too late. Too late for everything. Everybody here at Haverbrook despises us.

I hate you. I hate you. I hate you!

Peter

p.s. Simon also hates you, but he’s too angry to even email you

Gerry frowned at the screen. Peter had been sending him similar messages ever since that infernal Game was destroyed. When they are older they will thank him, Gerry figured. In a couple weeks they’ll have something else to obsess about. He trashed the message.

Don Driscoll sat in his spa suite at the Eastinn LAX hotel and contemplated his immediate future. He had delivered a tantalizing chunk of code to the woman on the phone, and she had called back agreeing to the fifty big ones. He figured O’hara would be pressing charges. Several years in Chile might be long enough take them off his back. He could change his name, start a small business, maybe get married again. In three hours he would finally have the jackpot he deserved. Don found HBO on the enormous flat screen TV, and settled back in the massage chair to watch The Mummy IV.
