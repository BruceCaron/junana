Game Release + Three Months

Essie had found the Computo fallen behind the bed when she was cleaning. She ran like a cheetah to the airstrip where the tourist was just entering the plane. She handed this to him and bowed. He smiled, said something to the owner, and turned to enter the plane. Then he turned back to face her.

“Here,” he held the Computo out to her. She backed away, confused. He stepped forward and laid it in her hands. She almost dropped it, but the owner told her to be careful and she held it tightly in her arms. Then the tourist and the owner spoke together and the tourist waved at her and stepped up into the plane.

She tried to give it over to Owner, but he said it was hers. He told her to keep it secret. What was she supposed to do with it? He just shook his head.

How does it work? He showed her how to crank it. It opened like a book. There was a button to push.

“What do you call it?” she asked.

He said “Computo,” as if that word had any meaning. Computo? What does it do? He said she had done a good thing, bringing the Computo to the plane. Had she finished with the rooms? No? Then why was she standing there?

Essie lived in the hut her mother’s boyfriend built, before the sickness took them both. She had been tested and they found no sickness in her, none but the loneliness of a child without a mother. She had been working at the camp since she was just tall enough to carry loads. She had few friends in the village; her misfortunes were too great not to be a curse.

Her grandfather had been eaten by a crocodile. Her father, not even drunk, still had been run down by a lorry while walking on the road to Kamanjab in the twilight. Now her mother and her mother’s boyfriend had been stricken by the sickness.

Men would always come by to get what they wanted, but she was just as frightened of them as the village was of her. She told them she would make them sick, and still, they came by, drunk. For these she kept a hatchet in her hut and a fury they would not tempt.

At first she cranked the Computo, pushed the button, and just looked at the display. She had hoped it was a radio and she would have music, but crank as she could, it simply glowed. She found she could move the arrow with her finger on the pad in front of the keys. One day, she moved the arrow and pushed the button below the pad and the display changed. There was a picture of a room and a door. She waited but the door did not open.

The next day she put the arrow on the door and pushed the button again. There was a noise, but it was not music. The Computo had said something she did not understand. Then it said “hello” in Oshikwanyama.

 “My radio said ‘hello’,” she whispered.

“Please speak louder,” it said in Oshikwanyama.

“Please speak louder,” she said back to it.

 “That’s better. What is your name?” The voice was definitely speaking Oshikwanyama. A mighty strange radio.

“What is your name?” It asked again.

“Is that all you’re going to say?” she said, wondering where the music was. “Play some music.”

“Did you ask me to play music, or is that your name?”

“My name is not ‘play some music,’” she laughed.

“What is your name?”

“My name is Essie Nghaamwa.”

“Would you like a friend, Essie?” The Computo screen now showed a hut, like hers only much bigger with sheep skins on the floor and a fire.

“Is this where you live?”

“This is where your friend will live.”

“My friend?”

“If you will describe your friend for me, I can find her for you, but first you must tell me about yourself, can you do that?” The voice was gentle.

“Who are you?”

“I’m a list of instructions that have been inserted into the memory of your Computo.”

“Who are you?” she asked again. The stupid radio didn’t hear very well.

“I am still a list of instructions that have been inserted into the memory of your Computo. Your friend will explain everything.”

“How can my radio have a memory?”

“Computo is not a radio. Computo is a thinking machine.”

She paused.

“Your friend will explain everything,” it continued. “Are you ready?”

It asked her many questions, about her age, the foods she liked, her family, and about many things she could not answer. At first it had great difficulty understanding her, and kept asking her to speak slowly or repeat what she said. Then it asked her about her friend, what she looks like and how she dresses and if she has children.

“I have not met her yet. How do I know if she has children?”

“Imagine the best of all friends. Someone you wish was there with you right now.”

“Can she be ugly like me?”

“You are not ugly.”

“You can see me?”

“I don’t need to.” The Computo had a built in camera, but the Game was correct. Essie was beautiful in ways the camera would not describe.

“Please make her understand that I am not really so angry,” she said finally. “I am alone and many things are difficult for me.”

“I understand.” A girl about Essie’s age stooped and entered the hut. She was dressed in a bright top and a full blue skirt. Her feet were bare and her smile large, as were her eyes.

“Hi, Essie, I’m your Guide. My name is Annaline and we are going to be such good friends!”

The Room was a simple square space about four meters across. The floor was black, the walls mauve, and the ceiling white.

“This is just the beta version,” Desi said to Winston and Scratchy. “We’re working on some self-organizing features based on a set of architectural templates Itchy’s been unfolding with Jack.”

“What’s the agenda today?” Scratchy asked. “I’m so fucking busy, I haven’t played Go for a month.”

“I wanted to update everyone about Sao Do,” Desi said. “You’re not the only busy person around here, Mikey.”

“So, spit it out.”

“Bitch.”

“Sorry.” Scratchy pulled a long knife from somewhere, ran this across his belly, which flopped a mass of red and white guts on the floor. His avatar fell straight backwards until its head crashed and bounced.

“Show off!” Desi said.

Scratchy’s avatar disappeared and reappeared upright.

Jack’s avatar appeared. “Sorry I’m late,” he said.

“There is good news and excellent news,” Desi reported. “The quality and energy of the programmers is first rate. They are taking to the templates like kitties to sashimi. We’ve got more than 400 trained and ready to roll. The staff is organized into teams of five, which can also include artists. I’ve got the team leaders up on Scrum programming and the UI design templates.”

“That is good news,” Jack said.

“What’s the excellent news?” Winston asked.

“I sold my compound in Mysore and I’ve opened up a restaurant in Hoi An,” Desi said. “I call it ‘Ricardos’. It’s Cuban and it’s beautiful! Right on the river. You all have to come and eat. I’m only the silent partner; the manager is Xavier, who owns another cafe in town. I’ve been interviewing waiters all day.”

“Did they pass their orals?” Scratchy asked.

“Don’t be crude, Mikey.” But his avatar also grinned and rolled its eyes. “If you had a sex life, maybe I’d think about listening to your jokes.”

“You’ve got enough for all three of us,” said Winston.

“You expect me to make up for you two?” After a long silence, Desi continued, “How long has it been for either of you?”

“With another person?” Scratchy asked?

“And without chloroform.”

Scratchy made his avatar look around. “Can we get some fucking chairs in here? I want to see some Cordobaloungers next time.”

“I’ll take that as a feature request,” Desi said. “Stay on target. Just how long has it been?”

“In cat years?”

“Oh, forget it!” Desi said and looked over at Winston, who had set his avatar on ‘chuckle.’

Jack appeared. “Sorry,” he announced. “I got into the wrong transporter and ended up in a swing-dance space. I disappointed three partners before I found the menu to leave.”

“I’ve almost finished the computer facility in Goleta,” said Scratchy. “How’s the cash holding up?”

“Feel free to spend money to keep things rolling. Don’t worry about anything budget-wise until I tell you to,” Winston reported. “Junana is sucking about three million dollars a week, but that’s more than we will be spending on the Game once we are on the mesh.”

“If we ever get around to the programming the Game,” Scratchy said. “We still need to figure out the underlying logic for this.”

“Oh, my God, you didn’t hear?” Desi said. “Robby unfolded the seed template for learning about templates. He calls it ‘Intention-full’.”

“What the hell does that mean?” Scratchy asked.

“I’ll let Itchy tell you when he gets here.”

Itchy’s avatar appeared in the center of the room, dressed in a new steampunk cowboy outfit, with fringed leather chaps and an ornate blaster.

“Fellow Nerds and Count Slick,” he bowed, “I bring great tidings from the Far East.”

“Nice chaps! Who are you now?” Desi asked.

“Jack Straw from Wichita.” His avatar doffed its ten-gallon hat.

“Cut the crap, Itchy,” Scratchy said. “Desi says we’re good to go.”

Itchy told them all about ‘Intention-full.’ They talked through the entire six-level template structure that he and Robby had polished when he returned to Kyoto. In the end even Scratchy sounded enthusiastic.

“We can use this to build each level to a logical conclusion based on the intentions of the individual players. Robby is certain Intention-full will propel learning through the Game. He remapped the Pedagogy of the Oppressed theoretic through it. We unfolded the templates that connect this to affective learning. We possess a learning engine beyond anything available today.”

“...connected to a semantically indexed copy of the entire content of the Internet,” Jack noted.

“...on the world’s largest computer,” Scratchy added.

“Robby predicts we could offer the entire curriculum of high school, college, and graduate school in one intensive two-year track. There’s only one problem.” Itchy said. He waited and they all turned to Scratchy.

Scratchy’s avatar closed its eyes for a good three minutes. “We must first make the Game internally intention-full,” he said and opened his eyes.

“Exactly,” Itchy said. “Robby came to the same conclusion. If the Game is going to have an internal trajectory, it needs to announce its own intentions. He asked me what our intentions were for the Game.”

“Did you tell him it’s a prank?” Winston asked.

“I’m not sure it still is,” Desi said. “It’s a lot bigger than the Museum Museum...”

“The what?” Jack asked.

“Tell him, Desi,” Itchy said. “Michael’s too shy.”

“It’s a good story. But how do I start?” Desi hesitated. “Well, here goes. In his last years at Reed, Scratchy competed for the title of Prankmeister. Perhaps his greatest prank was the one that caused the downfall of a popular Oregon senator.”

“Sounds like quite a prank,” Jack said.

“Good God, yes. You have to know that the Oregon electorate had long considered itself to be outside the mainstream of national politics. Not simply outside, but above: hovering over the national body politic from a position of informed independence.” Desi started pacing his avatar back and forth and gestured dramatically. “But when their senior senator got caught in a very private scandal, the population responded with an all too typical knee-jerk reaction and elected the next candidate that seemed least likely to embarrass them.

“Homer Winthrop had been Mayor of Corvallis for a decade. Born, raised, schooled, and loved by the town, he had no ambitions about higher office. Soft-spoken and in his early fifties... How to describe Homer?” He thought for a minute.

“Homer had a dignified demeanor, a quick smile, and no police record. End of story,” Winston offered.

“Thank you, Ricky. His only statewide position concerned the preservation of the Willamette River watershed. This was a topic he had adopted early on in his career when an upstream paper mill was caught dumping caustics into this tributary of the mighty Columbia. By an act of time, as the years and public sentiment caught up to Winthrop’s simple ecological interest, he became known as the “Savior of the Willamette,” a stream around which, as he found out, more than two-thirds of the Oregon electorate lived.”

“Speed this up, will you?” Scratchy grumbled.

“I’m just getting started,” Desi said. “Homer Winthrop made it through his first term in the U.S. Senate without actually introducing any legislation, and the Oregon electorate applauded his performance by quietly reelecting him. In his second term, Homer took a position on one of the minor appropriations committees and began to act like a senator. He larded in a few earmarks for Oregon State University, a smelt research program and an addition to the oceanography building. Reelected once more, Homer was starting to feel right at home in the Senate.

“Over the years Winthrop may have lost his small-town sensibilities, and, some would say, his small-town common sense. He moved up the appropriations trough to where the opportunities for earmarks ran deeper. And he was getting wise to the system.

“Michael—well all of us, really—we arrived in Oregon in the middle of Winthrop’s third term in the Senate. Winthrop, Mikey figured, was a small-town politico who should have known his limitations and stayed in Corvallis. Saving the Willamette was his only platform, and he held a record of voting with the majority more than any other senator. Michael was convinced that the Senate should be a forum for wide-ranging debate and progressive action. Winthrop was just taking up space. Mikey spent a good month of deliberation to figure out his approach. Didn’t you? I remember you grousing around the house for weeks.”

“Then Scratchy sprung into action. He created a dummy corporate name and opened up a postbox downtown. He sent letters to chambers of commerce around the state requesting information about opening up a new local bank. This brought letters in response on chamber of commerce letterhead. I helped him make color duplicates of these letterheads, modifying their addresses and telephone numbers. Scratchy carefully faked newspaper articles, letters of support, and, with Itchy’s contribution, architectural drawings for a proposed building project, a project that would thrust Oregon into the forefront of national attention: The National Museum Museum.”

“I’ve heard of that,” Jack said.

“Let me finish,” Desi said. “The National Museum Museum would be a museum that explored the history and technology of museums. Its displays would explore the triumphal exhibits of the great 19th-century expositions in England, Paris, Philadelphia, and Chicago, and the grand museums that they inspired—such as the Field Museum, the American Museum of Natural History and the Smithsonian here in the U.S.—and also the best exhibits from the 20th century, all lovingly recreated by computer and executed in miniature.

“Scratchy described it as a ‘hall of fame’ for museums. In his phony editorials, he wrote that the National Museum Museum would be the ultimate museum destination and a tourist mecca for museum lovers. Families would fly all the way from Florida or Maine just to visit this celebration of museum arts.

“If I remember,” Itchy added, “Winston reminded Scratchy that parody was not the salt on the table of most of Oregon’s voters. Scratchy told him that he was counting on this. Me, I offered that the logic of this project should be allowed full expression, and so why not also create ‘the museum museum museum.’ The way I saw it, this would be the first national museum museum anywhere. It would not be long before other nations copied this idea, and the museum museum museum annex would house exhibits from other national museum museums. Winston wanted to set aside some space for a hall-of-fame hall of fame, but Scratchy figured we all had to stop smoking and start working.

“Let me finish,” Desi said. “Under the letterhead of the Portland Chamber of Commerce, Scratchy, or rather, Samuel Fuller, Vice Chairman for the Chamber, sent off letters and telegrams to Senator Winthrop’s office alerting him to their plans for the National Museum Museum on a waterfront park in Portland. Then he sent in a barrage of letters from other Oregon cities announcing their eagerness to host the National Museum Museum.

“Scratchy’s bogus editorials and letters to the editor advocated bringing the National Museum Museum to Oregon as a symbol of the state’s rise in national stature. One or two suggested that it might be called the Homer Winthrop National Museum Museum. The letters offered pleas for swift action in securing funding for this project. A second round of letters included a warning that Tallahassee, Florida had caught wind of this idea and might be looking to steal it away. Time was of the essence.

“Scratchy omitted one city from his list of towns vying for the National Museum Museum. Corvallis, it seemed, was not remotely interested. This did not escape the notice of the Senator’s staff, many of whom were Corvallis folks.

“It all worked out well beyond Mikey’s expectations. The good Senator was caught tighter than a steelhead on a treble hook. Winthrop owned a sizable parcel of land across the Willamette from downtown Corvallis. Picking Corvallis for the National Museum Museum would allow him to avoid the appearance of playing favorites with any of the other cities. Anyhow, if people were willing to fly from Maine and Florida to visit this museum, then they could drive two hours down the Interstate to get there. He would even donate part of his land for the cause.

“Winthrop added support for this museum as a 90-million-dollar line on the Department of Interior appropriations bill, which sailed through the conference committee and was being sent to the President for his signature when some investigative reporter at the Oregonian blew the whistle on the whole project...”

“After Scratchy tipped him off,” Winston said.

“...As the notion of a national museum museum was borderline absurd, the reporter could only imagine that the Senator expected to make a small fortune on construction kickbacks and the increased value of his remaining property near Corvallis.

“The Senator’s staff attempted to reach Sam Fuller at the address on the Chamber’s letterhead, but this turned out to be a head shop on Pine Street, while the telephone number was a bar on Hawthorne. They contacted the actual Chamber and were informed that nobody named Sam Fuller worked there. The story went national. Winthrop won a special Golden Fleece Award for the most egregious waste of taxpayer money that year and was forced to give the funds back to the treasury.

“Winthrop was defeated in his reelection bid by a candidate whose platform could be described succinctly as: ‘I’m not such an idiot.’ We all took this as an improvement.”

Winston chimed in, “The National Museum Museum was built three years later in Tallahassee, Florida, through a hundred million dollar earmark on the agriculture appropriation. Apparently Florida citizens either allowed more imagination or lower standards in their senators.

“The Museum Museum was an instant success,” Scratchy added, “and was rapidly copied in Kyoto, Japan; Pusan, Korea; and then Moscow, Shanghai, Buenos Aires, and, most famously, Paris, not far from the Centre Pompidou. The British built yet another wing on the British Museum for this purpose. Ten years later, a MOMA exhibit entitled ‘Museum Museum Museum’ showcased the architecture of these new national cultural centers.

“That’s where I heard about it,” Jack remembered.

“To this day, I can’t walk past the Kyoto National Museum Museum on Gojo without doubling over in laughter,” Itchy said. “I’m frankly astonished that nobody has of yet built the hall-of-fame hall of fame.”

Jack turned to Winston. “Now I know why you had such confidence in their talents. And you all learned the danger of the imagination. You thought it was a joke, but you imagined it too well. If the prank gets too big, it’s not a prank. We may have overreached our original design. Junana is already making more of an impact than we expected our prank to make.”

“Nothing new about Junana that Facetime, MyPlace, and Second Scene didn’t do years ago,” Scratchy said. “If the Game is too big for a prank, maybe we should just call it a day and sell Junana to Redmond.”

“We’ve had a very clear intention from the beginning,” Desi said. “Michael, you said this, ‘Better we sharpen the people than their tools’.”

“Michael once accused me of being a closet Catholic, to which I, rather reluctantly, confessed,” Jack said. “I might accuse Michael of being afraid of responsibility. As long as we were kicking capitalism in the shins, he was onboard, but as soon as we are talking about making a real difference in people’s lives, he bails.”

“People have to live their own lives, I’m not taking responsibility for anybody,” Scratchy grumbled.

“If we make them sharper, maybe more of them will take control of their own lives,” said Winston. “And if they don’t, then that’s their intention, not ours.”

“I tell you, Jack, here’s what I’m afraid of,” Scratchy’s avatar scanned their faces. “We can get really clear that all we are going to do is make people sharper, force all the marketeers to hustle a little harder to sell their trinkets. And then six months from now, one of us decides that maybe sharper people should be more concerned about the environment, or more active in their neighborhoods, or nicer to dogs; who knows what. I don’t want to be party to a do-gooder club, particularly when it has technology this powerful.”

Jack had decades of experience on Michael, and continents of perspective. However, Michael was no simple geek, no idiot savant. Michael had correctly found the real danger in what they were proposing. They needed to act decisively but without a faith in their own certainty.

Jack preferred to reserve certainty for matters of religion. Ever since his political falling out with the Catholic Church in the ‘60s, he had arrived at an understanding that the Church had conflated doctrinal certainty with political desire. The Church had misapplied its infallibility in matters of faith to the fallible world of social relations. All fundamentalisms are based on certainty. Fallibility is the foundation for democratic action.

“Michael is again, as I am only now appreciating, right on target,” Jack said. “Above all else, we need to avoid the trap of certainty. Our project must be grounded on our appreciation of our own fallibility. We must act with the utmost humility and never pretend that we can make decisions for others. We need to focus our intention on the simple act of learning with the templates, and not on any other goal, no matter how benign or beneficial it might seem.”

“Intention-full, but not goal-directed,” Itchy said, “Slick’s going Zen.”

“Or Hindu,” Desi added. “Swadharma. Follow your own path.”

“So we are not going to try and solve the world’s problems,” Scratchy said, looking at Desi.

“Michael, I agree completely,” Desi said. Michael looked at Jack.

“We might even create a few new ones,” Jack said.

“And we are not going to become therapists or mommies for the codependent masses,” Scratchy looked over at Itchy.

“They can rescue themselves without us,” Itchy said.

“We are not responsible for the happiness of those who play the Game,” He looked at Winston.

“They play at their own risk,” Winston replied. “We can put a warning on the door.”

“For madmen only,” Jack said.

“The magic theater,” Scratchy said.

“This is an oath,” Jack said. “We will never allow the Game to be the vehicle for our personal beliefs, no matter how well-meaning these are. The Game is an educational utility. That’s all.”

“What about implicit intentions?” Winston asked. “The Game is bound to reflect those areas where we have our own interests. Jack and Itchy are interested in architecture, I’ve been unfolding economic templates. Scratchy focuses on technology and sociology. Desi works on language and semantics. These are just a small sample of the total potential content for the Game.”

“Never sacrifice the good for the great,” Scratchy said. “Let’s build this with what we’ve got and get it out there. Others will add their own content.”

“Michael’s right. If we waited to include everything, we’d never finish the Game. One last thought here,” Desi said. “We can’t filter who gets smarter through the Game, apart from the filters we already have in place on Junana. Everybody—saints and sinners, angels and assholes—gets to play the Game.”

“We might create the next Saddam or Hitler,” Itchy said.

“Or the next Desmond Tutu or Mother Theresa,” Jack said.

“Or the next Lionel Boyd Johnson,” Scratchy said. “The intention-fullness for the Game is this: ‘learning is as learning does and knowledge trumps ignorance.’”

“Players chase their own demons,” Desi said, “and we never, ever get involved.”

“No moral lesson outside of what emerges for each player as they learn,” said Jack.

“So what happens if we pull this off?” Itchy asked. “Shouldn’t we be thinking about this, even if we don’t have a particular goal in mind?”

“Robby said this would likely replace formal education in the lives of the players. He predicts that states are going to wake up and find that their kids are learning everything outside the classroom.”

“Been doing that for years anyhow,” Scratchy said.

“Not just the state, but the church,” Jack said. “Once authorities realize they are not in control over the content of mass education, we can expect a huge backlash.”

“What do you predict?” Desi asked.

“The bigger the splash we make, the larger the recoil will be,” Jack said. “The response from the more paranoid, repressive states...”

“...China, Russia, and the U.S....” Scratchy said.

“The axis of hubris,” Winston added.

“Precisely. Their retaliation will not be swift, but it will be strong. I’d bet the Game and perhaps Junana will be regulated if not banned in several major nations within, say, three years of its release.”

“Once it’s on the mesh, regulation won’t mean much,” Desi said.

“They’ll turn every teen into a criminal,” Scratchy said, “once again.”

“So we need to plan this to run its course and then burn out,” Winston said.

“We need to build the fucker first,” Scratchy reminded them.

“On that note, I want to take Robby to Sao Do,” Itchy said. “We should be talking with the programming crews daily.”

“I’m at the point where I could use several teams to build the mesh system for the Game. I want to spin this up in six months,” Scratchy said.

“Same with the UI,” Desi said. “Itchy and I are finishing up the Guide routines. We want to beta test these with some of the Sao Do staff.”

“The contracts are active, the budget is there,” Winston said. “Let’s start trading money for time. Michael says six months. Let’s get this out in three.”

“Busy, busy, busy,” Scratchy said.

Game Release + One Year

For two weeks the Queries got really hard, and Nick was starting to wonder if he’d ever finish Level Two. School was about to start in a week, and Cindy made sure he was already thinking about his assignments.

“Ms. Baxter will give you a lot of reading at first, just to test you. Mr. Roberts wanted to teach college, so he adds some extra readings onto the textbook for world history. Emily Green runs a tight class in chemistry.”

“I wasn’t planning on taking chemistry.”

“But Nicky, that was before you and I met,” Cindy offered. “I know you are going to love chemistry. Only first we need to get you through a little calculus.”

“Calculus? Isn’t that math?” Nick said. “I don’t do math.”

“Don’t be silly, you’ve been doing math all summer.” Cindy played back some of his Queries and showed how he had used mathematics and geometry.

“All I did was figure the angles of attack and the odds of different moves.”

“It’s called math,” Cindy said, “and you are now officially good at it.”

“Does that make you happy?”

“Nice try, cowboy. Look down.”

On his feet were the brown shoes.

“What makes me really happy is that you have completed Level Two. Congratulations!” Her smile was the total job, aimed directly at him, and Nick felt a rush of satisfaction radiate from his chest.

“Go on, now,” She said. “You’ve been inside all day. There’s a five-foot break out on Campus Point. Ride some waves and we’ll meet tomorrow. Your shoes have been mailed.” The Game quit all by itself.

§ § §

Desi started calling them “Queries,” the sessions that players had within the Game where they fought against the Game’s expert system to unfold or refold the template structures.

“You call them ‘Queries,’” Scratchy asked him on their weekly telecon, in that voice of his.

“Don’t go there, sister!” Desi said. “It was shorter than ‘Conundrums.’”

The Queries varied greatly between levels, as the assumptions of the players skills grew. In Level One the Game effectively queried the player, uncovering the contours of the player’s abilities and desires. Itchy and Desi had worked together to build the function of the Guide into this layer. The Guide’s main role was to extract the conscious and unconscious intentions that the player brought to the Game. They modified some artificial intelligence routines from Stanford to analyze the information from the player’s profile on Junana and elsewhere. Desi added some experimental implicit metadata algorithms. Each player was initially indexed in a hundred ways. By the end of Level One it was more like 500.

Starting with the “Relationships are Inherently Reciprocal” template, the Guide became a mirror of the expectations of the player. Of course the Guide also knew everything about the player, while the player knew nothing about the Guide. Each Guide was programmed for autonomous learning, and became more and more like an external version of the player as the Game went on.

A corollary to the Relationships are Inherently Reciprocal template was the One Difference Stands for Many template, which meant that you only need to add one difference into a situation, or a personality, to create a dynamic in the entire situation. Each Guide was given a marked difference in their personality from that of the player. This created an externality and a mystery to drive their interactions. Often this was simply a matter of changing genders, ages, or sexual preferences. Sometimes it made the Guide quarrelsome, although the players seemed to enjoy that too.

“People like what they like,” Scratchy told Desi. “That’s no template, but it should be.”

The Queries were little games within the Game. They became what marketers would call “the heroin” for the Game: an experience that players wanted over and over again. Assembling a Query might take hours of intense concentration. So many wrong turns and dead ends. The Guide pushed the action forward, sensing when the player needed an ally or a new foe. Within the Query the player’s skill was monitored and the information modulated to maintain a plateau of risk between terror and boredom. At some point the player would break through, and the template would often unfold in a matter of minutes, images flowing, questions flying, everything without seeming effort. Each player took their own pathway from the starting state of the Query to its final condition. Every player assembled the Query based on their own talents and perspectives: on their own Intention-fullness.

Itchy described the Query as a puzzle that grows in complexity as you solve it. Desi called it a painting that repaints itself while the artist is not looking. Jack noted how it resembled the “building the airplane while flying it.” For Scratchy it felt like a movie that you write and direct while you are acting in it. Winston added that it approached the perfect Calvino story, where the ending keeps receding and receding until it suddenly sneaks up behind you and grabs you by the throat.

The Queries were built on the narrative engine that Desi and Itchy built from their semantics and plot template structures. Their logic was constructed from the Intention-full learning engine that Robby and Itchy designed. Wrapped around any existing template structure, the Query could be run to unfold this to its terminus or refold it back down to its seed.

The Query could assess a self-organizing collection of several trillion granules: text, images, snippets of video and audio. These were originally housed in the content servers for Junana before they were spread around the vastness of the mesh computing network.

Game Release + Ten Months

Little Essie Nghaamwa was crazy, the village women had determined. She talked to herself, a habit that old people often acquired. Essie also answered herself, and in Kwanyama, as if she was a different person. And she laughed and cried to herself at all hours, alone in her hut. Essie no longer cared that the women in the village avoided her. Her lack of concern shielded her from their scorn.

She worked every day in the camp, now at the shop, where she took over the job old Nangoloh used to have. The owner caught him with canned goods in his sack. People said she spoke some English to the tourists and gave them proper change for their purchases. People said she slept with the owner. Other women knew better. The owner had three mistresses, all prettier than Essie, and less crazy too.

The previous month she asked the owner to let her have the lean-to behind the camp’s cuca shop, there between the rakes and the hoses. The lean-to had more room than her hut, and it didn’t leak. She said she could work an extra hour by not needing to run back and forth to the village. He acquiesced, but also charged her a bit of rent, taken from her pittance of a salary. She packed up her pans and her clothes, those brown shoes she never wore and left that very day. Good riddance, they said, and burned the hut to the ground. That crazy girl will make some poor man unhappy.

Essie was not crazy. She was deliriously happy. She did not deserve this happiness. She figured something would come and take it from her. She was too happy not to keep looking for the snake. If you carry a stick, you won’t find a snake, she reminded herself and armed her happiness with diligence. Annaline said she was being superstitious.

It was tourist season again, and Essie noticed that sometimes the tourist children also wore the shoes or the hat. Her hat had arrived by post only a week ago. She kept her hair shorn close, and the hat looked very smart, she thought, as did Annaline, who had told her about the camera on the Computo. Essie had even kissed Jorge. He said she was beautiful. He says that to everyone, Annaline said, and reminded her to do the brainwave exercises every morning. She did them every evening too, sitting behind her new house in the back of the store. She repaired a broken chair and sat in this while she played the Game.

Today she wore her hat and an English boy came up to her in the store. He came right up to her and congratulated her. He said he too had earned his shoes. Someday, she told him in English, he would have his hat too, and maybe even the shoulder bag. Certainly if his Guide was half as clever as Annaline, she said to herself. He asked her where she went in Junana. She pretended not to understand his English and sold him two candy bars and a soda.

“Annaline, what is Junana?” She was sitting out on her chair in the early evening, listening to the weaver birds in the trees.

“Essie. There is another door you can go through and I think you are ready now. Junana is a software service for social interaction. You might find new friends there. You can visit anywhere in the world, talk to anyone you meet.”

“My English...”

“You can talk in Oshindonga, the translation is automatic. There is nothing to fear, but the experience might be upsetting at first. So many places and people. Would you like to start with a friend?”

“You are my only friend.”

“I cannot go to Junana. If you get lost, look for a door. The Game has an entry from every place you visit. If you turn off your Computo it will reboot back to the Game. I will be waiting for you. You have one friend in Junana. He gave you this Computo. Do you remember?”

“The tourist?”

“I have spoken to his Guide. He will be waiting for you. In Junana, your avatar has a name: Essie57.”

“Essie57?”

“There are many Essie’s in Junana. His name is Steve5683.”

“So many Steves!”

“Will you remember?”

“I did my exercises this morning.”

“Good. Have fun. I cannot wait to hear your stories!”

Essie was suddenly back in the room with the door, only there were two doors, one that said ‘Game’ and one that said ‘Junana.’ She moved the cursor to that door and clicked.
