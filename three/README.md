# Three
Over the next week, with a day off for the New Year’s celebration, which the Nerds spent partying in their hotel suites and laughing as the whole Y2K scare fizzled across the planet, the routine was roughly the same: extensive mountain walks through the day, another restaurant to try, and then an hour or two in the baths of Yanagi Yuu.

They managed to agree on everything but the core action they would attempt. They were more and more invested in the idea of doing something, but that something always eluded them. Itchy suggested a new religion, and they wrestled with this idea for a solid day before discarding it.

“Religion leaves out all the people who figure they’ve already got one,” Scratchy noted. “We’d have to convert them or kill them.”

“Then how about science,” Winston suggested. “We could create a new one.”

“Out of what?” Scratchy asked.

“If we map the content of science as we now know it, I’m sure we’d find entire arenas that are not well covered, or perhaps a whole new method that could turn science in a different direction.”

“That’s the scope of project I think we’re looking for,” Mr. Slick agreed.

“A new science,” Desi pondered. “What fun is that?”

“And where would we start?” Itchy asked. And they spent another day on Mt. Arashiyama trying, without result, to answer that question.

Their last night at the baths, Mr. Slick presented them with a challenge. They would become anonymous, invisible, footloose. He owned a company that managed a growing global franchise of espresso coffee houses under the name “Red Star.” Their decor was distinguished by large photographs of the Paris Commune, marble bistro tables, and actual zinc countertops. Already there were 3000 franchise locations in 28 nations. This gave Mr. Slick a perfect alibi for international travel, an alibi he would now share with the Nerds. He’d hire them as managers in a subsidiary company with responsibilities for “franchise inspection.”

Winston’s cover would be problematic. He had developed a visible presence in the world of international finance, and could not disappear or move about as freely as the rest of them under an alias without some notice.

“I’ve given this serious consideration, and I think the only safe solution is for Winston to travel as Winston. And since nobody at Red Star Coffee has any business with Winston, he will never attend any of our future meetings. In fact, it is best that none of you meet with Winston again after we leave Kyoto.”

“Game over!” Scratchy blurted, “If Winston’s out, I’m out!”

“I did not mean to suggest...” Mr. Slick raised his hand and continued, “...that Winston will not be present in our gatherings or less significant to our plan, but only that he will need to phone in from a secure location in the U.S. We cannot afford to be seen with him.”

“He’s right,” Winston added. “For me, business-as-usual is the best cover. I know the CIO at the Drexel, and I’ve been meaning to set up a fiber connection from their network to my office on Rittenhouse Square.”

“I’ve been working on some scrambling compression algorithms for voice over IP,” Itchy noted. “We can all use this for teleconferencing between meetings, and Winston can call in when we’re gathered. I think we can set something rather difficult for anyone to decode without some serious iron and bad intent.”

“By the time we attract such attention, whatever we plan to accomplish must be beyond stopping,” Mr. Slick reminded them as he bade them farewell.

The next morning, Winston gathered his friends together at the Miyako Hotel restaurant.

“It’s decision time,” he told them. “Each one of us is either all in or all out.”

“Slick’s got a good point,” Scratchy said. “Free market capitalism is just pushing the planet back into some new dark age of fantasy walled enclaves for the very rich and sallow terror for the rest of us.”

“Except in this case, we are among the very rich,” Desi reminded him.

“We won the dot-com lotto,” Itchy said. “Lucky us.”

“So we just hang out in five-star hotels and watch the coming shit storm from afar?” Scratchy asked.

“Or we work out some way to turn the storm around,” Winston said. “That’s why we’re here.”

“Why does it take all our assets?” Desi asked.

“Buy in,” Winston said. “No exit but success.”

“Fuckin A,” Scratchy said. “Count me in!”

One by one they all nodded in agreement.

§ § §

The next of their gatherings was convened six months later at a beach resort near Hoi An in Vietnam, a country where Red Star Coffee had just opened 22 stores after years of negotiating with the party potentates in Hanoi. The coffee was highland Vietnamese, and the décor was pure nineteenth-century Paris. The locals loved it; the elderly were flooded by their nostalgia for the French colonial ambiance. The children of the elderly responded to the communist overtones. The grandchildren hungered for the chain’s global music and cosmopolitan flair.

Hoi An was a gem, a seventeenth-century town on a muddy river delta. The nearby beaches were immaculate. In town, Red Star had purchased a hulking Chinese merchant house, thick beamed and clad in terra cotta, and restored this entirely, with only a small metal star as a sign. Up the coast near Danang, Red Star was building its regional headquarters and several other manufacturing operations.

At the remote beach resort hotel, Mr. Slick rented a cabana at the end of a long pathway fronting the ocean across a stretch of buff-colored sand. Two large white umbrellas on the tiled patio shaded four teak and canvas loungers.

They pulled the deck chairs near the sliding glass door so that they could communicate with Winston through Itchy’s laptop computer on a low table, tethered to an Ethernet cable.

Itchy’s encryption software had allowed them to hold weekly teleconferences where they continued to brainstorm on the core action of their proposed global prank.

During the past month, they explored the value of starting a whole new language as the basis for a profoundly deeper reflexive understanding on a global scale. Mr. Slick was intrigued. He envisioned a new international society talking politics and philosophy in a new language. Desi reminded them of the limits of semantics.

“The only improvement we can invent would be a new way to tell really good lies,” Desi concluded. “That’s not going to help anyone.”

“President Stone could use it,” Scratchy offered.

“I think our politicians are adept enough at obfuscation,” Winston sighed.

“In other words, they already lie faster than nickel whores,” Scratchy said.

This sent them all back to step one. Over the next two days, they considered a variety of modalities: new forms of art, community, media, sports, cultural expressions, festivals, and even comic books.

“Is there any way to open up to a new mode of cinema?” Itchy mused. “Movies have just become embarrassing. There’s an industry that needs a shot in the arm...”

“...or the head,” Scratchy added. “We could revisit the opening moments of new cinema in the 60s and try to see what went so horribly wrong.”

“The world doesn’t need a new avant-garde telling it where to go,” Desi cut in. “Whatever we do has to be viral, grass-roots. We need to grab them by the gonads, not the frontal lobes.”

The others nodded slowly.

“I could demonstrate,” Desi looked at Itchy and then at Scratchy.

“Grab your own balls,” Scratchy growled.

The list of world-shaking events they could imagine were mostly unattractive.

“Nothing like a world war or a global epidemic to shake things up,” Scratchy noted. “Once the carnage is done, the survivors have more options.”

“Start a war, and you have the winners to deal with,” Winston said. “Winning breeds the worst of radical conservatism. It only encourages the bastards. Look what happened after the Cold War: a decade of triumphalist nationalism.”

“Winning a war is a free ticket to neofascism,” Itchy added, “We need something that creates its own positive feedback loop away from the present.”

“An epidemic kills all the wrong people,” Desi said. He fell silent and looked out to the sea, lost in a montage of bitter memories.

Rebooting the world, they determined, would be one part vision and nine parts process. And the processes they could imagine with a certain finitude were all in the realm of information technology.

“I think we are back to hardware and software,” Scratchy concluded. “If we’re going to shake a tree, this is the one we at least know how to climb.”

“I’ve been thinking about multiplayer gaming,” Itchy said. His early patents in self-animating autonomous agents formed the basis for several game platforms as well as digital film effects: crowd scenes in battlefields where hundreds of digital warriors are moving independently.

“Games are as lame as movies,” said Scratchy, “and ten times as hard to make.”

“That’s just because nobody’s figured out how a game can teach anything useful,” Winston added.

“If we want to wean the teens away from soft porn and mayhem, we’ll need something wicked fantastic,” Desi noted.

“What about adults?” Mr. Slick asked.

“Geezers won’t turn off their TVs even if you paid them to,” Scratchy said.

“Americans spend hundreds of billions of hours a year watching TV,” Mr. Slick said. “Think about the cognitive surplus that represents. We just have to tap into it.”

“Exactly what is our message?” Itchy asked.

“I didn’t know we had one,” Scratchy said. “Who are we to tell a million teenagers anything?”

“Make that 100 million,” Mr. Slick replied. He stood up and walked to the edge of the patio, gazing over at the hotel’s caparisoned elephant carrying three blond children across the beach in a howdah.

He turned back to them, animated. “Look! Electricity, penicillin, gunpowder, the aerofoil: some inventions have made huge changes for the lives of everyone.”

“You want us to reinvent electricity?” Scratchy shook his head.

“I want us to think fundamentally.”

They sat in silence for some time.

“We can sharpen the tools people use,” Scratchy said, “but it would be better to sharpen the people.”

“Say that again,” Winston demanded. Everyone looked at Scratchy.

“I’m saying that all the software gadgets we can build are not as valuable as the minds that use them.”

“You think we can make kids smarter?” Itchy asked.

“What if you knew at age seventeen what you knew at age twenty-five?” Mr. Slick asked.

“I knew a lot of things by age twenty-five,” Desi said, grinning, “that I’m not sure I would have been ready to handle at seventeen.”

“You knew a lot of things by age thirteen,” Itchy reminded him.

“Everything I know I learned behind the kindergarten,” Desi said.

“What if kids were smarter than their teachers?” Itchy asked. “They already know more about computers than their teachers will ever learn.”

“What if kids were smarter than the marketplace?” Mr. Slick whispered, visibly excited.

“Smart enough to think before they buy?” Scratchy started to smile. “Smart enough to laugh at the ads in the glossy magazines?”

“Smart enough to think twice about what they eat?” Winston asked.

“Or what they wear?” Desi added.

“Or what they believe?” Itchy said.

Game Release + Four Months

If it weren’t for Cindy, Nick would have dropped the Game midway through the first level. The graphics were gloriolus, but the learning curve was vertical. Still, whenever he got stymied, there she was, in his face, telling him to stop fucking around, or fighting against him, and then it got good.

His avatar moved with its own cat-like instinct. Nick controlled the basic tactics, attacks and retreats, but it was his avatar who refused to die unless Nick did something really stupid, like moving inside Cindy’s hand weapon range. Then it was lights out and he’d wake up on his back with her standing over him bitching at him one minute, holding out her hand the next, and sending him to another sector, where he had to learn the landscape and the rules all over again in a totally different way before the action would even start.

Before every sector, there was Wanda and Jorge, in their video doing the hand motions, and Cindy telling him to take his eyes off of Wanda’s tits for a minute and do the same hand motions because it opened up a doorway in his brain. And he’d tell her he could do the hand motions and watch Wanda’s tits at the same time, since she was doing the hand motions right in front of them. Somehow Cindy knew when he skipped the hand motions, and she’d stop the sector and pull up the video with Wanda and Jorge again. It only took a few minutes, she’d say.

“Do it now!” Cindy barked, “Or say ‘adios,’ ‘cause I’m gone.”

“OK, All right.” Nick put down the mouse and followed along with Wanda, wonderful Wanda. She with the coral white smile and the Pacific blue eyes.

Left over right, sideways with the left hand, circle with the right, move the eyes with the forefinger. Tap, tap, tap on your eyes and your chin. Open the door to your memory. Then the sector would start and he’d spend some hours hunting around, figuring out the logic and the strategy to beat it. When the monster finally showed up, it would kick his ass a few times, and make him guess the answers to a series of questions, and then make him ask it other questions, and then the final combat would begin and there was Cindy, slaying the minions with her long sword while Nick attacked the big slimer with an axe. It would kick his ass some more and he and Cindy would need to find the cave with the potion that put the slimer to sleep so he could sneak in and slit its ugly throat. More than one way to kill that cat.

On the next sector it might be techno-warfare or counter terror, but always a whole new logic, and always there was Wanda and Jorge before every session. Now Nick could do the hand motions in his sleep, only his sleep was also filled with visions from the Game, and more questions to ask. On it went, either down in Santa Barbara at his mom’s house, or up in Lompoc with his dad. Both of them were too busy to bother him much, and happy he wasn’t out getting into trouble. So he played day and night, and before the end of four months he was at Level Two.

§ § §

Mr. Slick started the telecon conversation. Desi, Itchy, and Scratchy were also on the line. “Where are we? Michael, you mentioned this was an emergency. What’s that all about?”

“We’ll have to wait for Winston. It’s all his fault.”

“White lightning, this is ground beef control, over.” A familiar voice crackled faintly on the line.

“Winston!” Desi said. “Where are you? You sound like you’re on Mars.”

“I’m in Kiev. I’ll just have to shout.”

“Hello, Winston,” Mr. Slick said, “I received your message about the template phenomenon. Surely you’re not serious.”

Months before, Winston had sent them all an encrypted email about his research into Constantine’s template theory. Emanuel Constantine, in a series of books that attracted a widening audience, argued for a new epistemology, a new way of considering beauty and truth, based on the unfolding of a universal tessellation of what he called “templates.” Each template considered a specific problem space, and maintained a set relation to templates of neighboring problem spaces.

Then, in a 2000 book, Template Technology, written by two of Silicon Valley’s technorati, Constantine’s templates were shown to have enormous practical applications in software design.

The authors had unfolded the primary template tessellation for the programming design cycle, optimizing software development with objects well beyond what was possible through extreme programming. Their first eight code templates caused a rush of new code techniques. By the middle of 2001, they added seven new templates. Combinations of these fifteen templates were being inserted into virtually every new software project on the planet, from high-end massive multiplayer games to sensors in toasters.

This came to Winston’s attention when his derivatives for chip manufacturers began being used by software companies retiring the enormous code bases they had used for the past thirty years. Major players were jettisoning billions of Euros of software inventories as they converted their efforts into template-based code. As far as Winston could tell, only NASA and the CIA refused to upgrade.

“Mr. Slick,” Winston replied. “I am not only serious, I am profoundly excited.”

“Really?” Desi chimed up.

“Since your message, I’ve been playing with the 15 techno-templates,” Itchy admitted.

“The templates fit together like fuckin’ Legos,” Scratchy added. “I’ve never seen code that you can plug and play like that.”

“In two weeks, I rewrote the core code for DocDo,” Desi said. “And now it’s finally small enough to run on a cell phone.”

“A cell phone!” Mr. Slick marveled. DocDo was one of Desi’s code masterpieces. It enabled nearly instantaneous translation between dozens of languages. Put it on a cell phone and you could talk to almost anyone in the world.

“That’s what I was trying to say,” Winston added. “There’s something in this whole template scheme we need to investigate.”

“The three of you have been building software for decades,” Mr. Slick said. “Scratchy, your networking software was the launch pad for the second-generation Internet. Itchy, your avatars rule the game world. And Desi, you’ve broken the barriers of language that have separated the world since Babel. You did this all before templates. So why change now?”

There was silence on the line as everyone waited for Scratchy to speak.

“Let’s say you want to build your dream house,” Scratchy started. “But you discover that all the trees belong to someone else, and so you need to grow your own forest to harvest for the lumber for your house.”

“Why don’t you buy your lumber from a lumber yard?” Mr. Slick asked.

“Every house is different,” said Itchy. “Their lumber doesn’t fit your plan.”

“Besides,” Winston noted, catching on, “Their lumber is really expensive. You’d be better off buying an already built house, but you want to build your own house. Your dream house.”

“So now someone creates a magic forest,” said Desi, “A forest that is already grown and is free to use.”

“And the lumber from this forest is not only free, but exactly what you are looking for,” Winston added.

“So you build your dream house,” Itchy said. “And you are very happy. But there is one catch.”

“A catch,” Mr. Slick said.

“It’s not entirely yours.” Winston’s voice rang like the pronouncement of a criminal sentence.

“You can have your dream house, only you can’t keep others from having it too,” Itchy said. “But what’s wrong with that?”

“You’ve made it from magic wood,” Desi remarked. “And if your dream is a good one, others will copy it.”

“How?” Mr. Slick asked. “It’s your design.”

“But it’s not my lumber,” Scratchy said. “Tell him, Winston.”

“The magic wood, or in this case, the code templates, are public, and so are their combinations. If you create software using these, you have every right to enjoy the benefits of their use, and to sell the products you make. But you have no right to prevent others from doing the same thing.”

“And if you don’t use the templates, then you’re back to growing your own goddamn forest before you can start to build your house,” Scratchy said.

“That’s why software companies are dumping billions of Euros of old code as they upgrade,” Winston added.

“And...?” Scratchy said.

“And a million coders are going back to working at Wal-Mart,” Desi nodded.

“And...?” Scratchy said.

“And software is getting better, instead of just bloatware,” Itchy says.

“Bloatware?” Mr. Slick asked.

“Template technology is going to make software programs smaller,” Itchy said.

“Faster and simpler,” Scratchy added.

“Cheaper all around,” Winston chimed in.

“And the best part,” Scratchy said. Now they all waited for him to have the last word. “It’s fun again.”

“When we decide what to do,” Mr. Slick said, “you’ll use the templates.”

“The templates are what we do,” Scratchy replied.

Mr. Slick fell silent.

“Nobody’s figured out how to get the templates to tessellate across semantic domains,” said Itchy.

“That’s the fuckin’ point,” replied Scratchy. “Do something nobody’s done before.”

Scratchy continued. “Everyone’s been looking at the fifteen templates like that’s the end of the story. Hell, it’s just the start.”

“You bad boy, you,” Desi started, “What have you been up to?”

Scratchy stood up and moved to the railing of the porch, turning to face them.

“I’ve unfolded the templates through six more levels.”

“What?” Winston struggled to hear what Scratchy said.

“When the entire system is fully unfolded some things become crystal clear.” Scratchy paused and then continued. “Mr. Slick, twenty years ago I wrote a thesis on the impossibility of distributed mesh computing.”

“Mikey has a paradox named after him,” Desi said. “He’s so smart.”

“The more computers you allow to have control over concurrency, the more latency you get from the system,” Scratchy continued. “It’s the ‘too many cooks spoil the soup’ problem. You can scale up to a few thousand CPUs and then everything breaks down. You either need to build in a threaded control system, code in arbiters, or go massively parallel. But when you’re working with all thirty-six templates, the concurrency paradox disappears.”

“You can build the mesh?” Winston’s voice trembled. Itchy started to laugh.

“Mesh? Now I’m lost,” said Mr. Slick.

“It means the ‘O’hara transparent concurrency paradox’ is toast,” Itchy said. “It means the future of computing is now a lot closer to the present.”

“We wanted to shake up the world,” Scratchy replied. “And now we have the shaker.”
