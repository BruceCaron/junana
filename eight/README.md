Robby Robinson, Ph.D., took a tenfold pay increase to move to Kyoto in order to partner with Ichiro Nomura on an Internet-based immersive education effort. Robby had spent the previous four years in Sao Paulo, Brazil. He was working through a multinational educational NGO with connections across South America to implement “liberation education” practices for the urban poor.

Liberation education had been created against the dominant mode of education, where the teacher was the source of all knowledge and the student merely an empty vessal to be filled over the course of years. Liberation was all about context and learning moments. Teaching liberation education paid like shit, but something in it spoke to Robby, something there that demanded exploration. Winston’s email had mentioned a salary well beyond what Robby could ignore. Going to Kyoto was just the type of lifestyle change he had recently begun to fantasize in his modest (and that was a charitable adjective) Sao Paulo studio apartment.

The Greek holding company Winston set up to hire Ichiro as their technical lead on the Junana design project had leased an entire building in Kyoto on Karasuma Dori, just north of Doshisha University, and across the street from a large construction zone where a new dormitory was going up. On the ground floor Ichiro oversaw the construction of a massive parallel XServe computer system. Their offices were under construction on the floor above that.

While the offices were being finished, Robby and Ichiro engaged in long conversations at the Red Star Coffee shop near Demachiyanagi or over at Fiasco, a gaijin-run Italian restaurant on Kamidachiuri. Ichiro brought Robby up to speed on the templates, while Robby gave Ichiro a crash course in the Pedagogy of the Oppressed.

At first they talked right past each other; the formalism of Ichiro’s templates and the exuberance of Robby’s pedagogy seemed entirely orthogonal with no mutual purchase point. Ichiro’s background in physics, cyberinformatics, and video game design had him looking for problems to solve, while Robby’s training in psychology and critical sociology kept him searching for ambiguities and power relationships. Still, they developed an appreciation for one other’s talent. Robby found in Ichiro another keen intellect, and underneath that, a person with a galloping curiosity and a capacity for self-reflection.

Ichiro enjoyed Robby’s enthusiasm for the science of pedagogy and his desire to use his academic training to transform the academy. Robby was also a true nerd, completely unselfconscious. He wore the same type of madras-print shirt and chino pants every day. His energy put his hands in constant movement, and he would absentmindedly brush others in the close confines of the kissaten or simply knock his own glasses off his face.

Essie cranked her Computo furiously. She had forgotten not to let the power drain below five percent and her Guide had to interrupt her Free-for-All time to prompt her.

“Whatcha doin’, girl?” Annaline scolded her. “Is your arm broken?”

Annaline spoke with a lilting Oshikwanyama accent. At first, Essie was convinced Annaline must be from Endola.

“I’m not from anywhere, silly,” she had told Essie. “I am just a basket of pieces of light here in your Computo.”

Essie was already late for her job cleaning rooms at the Oasis Lodge on the river. She would carry her beloved Computo under her skirts all day, never, ever letting it out of her sight.

“Be still, Annaline, I’ve almost finished.” She had been exploring a problem in desert hydrology, a topic of everyday import to her people, but not one that a 16 year-old girl  in her village normally encountered. Already there was talk in the village about Essie. There is always talk in the village.

“You are late again,” Annaline said. “Are you working on West African Internal Time, or what? Paife, paife, paife! You must run, or they will beat you or worse.”

Annaline somehow knew exactly where Essie was, a part of the magic of the Computo she did not yet understand, but she was beginning to. Her village had no electricity, no phone service. How did the Computo work?

“Way up in the sky there is a machine that moves across the heavens. The Computo talks to this,” Annaline explained. Perhaps the machine can look down and see her. She waited for the rains to come and the clouds to hide her from this machine. Still it found her. She did not understand.

She turned off the Computo and slipped it into the sleeve she had sewed in front of her petticoat. Then she ran from her hut, across the open land, hard packed and cracked from drought, to the river, where they had built the fishing camp and the airstrip.

In weeks, Robby had picked up a fair amount of Japanese. Every time he accidentally struck someone, he would offer a humble apology while looking around at them. When they turned to see who had smacked them, their eyes met the green eyes of a crimson-haired gaijin, mumbling in formal Japanese. This usually startled them more than the accidental slap.

As Ichiro listened to Robby explain the pedagogy, it was as if the corpse of socialism, like so many before, had beached itself on the shores of education theory. He was wary of the litany of an oppressed proletariat forced to swallow whole lumps of bourgeois knowledge, which, like the whale meat on the food floor of Takashimaya, carried more political significance than flavor.

Ichiro considered it entirely reasonable that states had zero interest in training the population to rebel. These were, after all, grossly paranoid and paternalist systems. Who could blame them if they removed the dynamite sticks from their offspring’s chubby fists? That did not excuse the fact that modern democracies had long mistaken quietude for peace, and relied heavily on soporific practices—sporting events, popular music, reality TV—to keep the public distracted. At the same time, states used a slow drumbeat of potential terror and urban fear to justify their existence. Holding at “Condition Orange” seemed about right: dangerous enough for no-bid contracts  in the war zones but safe enough for people to drive to work.

Ichiro argued that there was a lot of money, time, and effort put into getting an ever-larger cohort of the population into college, where, if Reed College were any indication, the language of rebellion was a freshman requirement. The real problem, he insisted, was a lack of a target for any revolutionary impulse since the collapse of socialism. Anyhow, as Jack had noted, the main enemy was fundamentalism, religious or political. But fundamentalism, like democracy, came in a wide range of styles and impacts.

You could argue that the world needed more openness than what representative democracy could provide, particularly under late capitalism. The only real arena now was the marketplace, where Alcoa and al Qaeda shared a common dream—a world where relationships between people and groups were under the stable control of some traditional cadre of leaders. Democracy was a convenient fiction to reproduce the legitimacy of these leaders. Every student at Reed went through this conversation at least once in their dorms their first year.

Robby countered that most of the population did not and could not learn the language of rebellion because they had been subjected to an educational system that sucked away their curiosity and dulled their ability to recognize the meanings behind the advertisements. He gestured at the room around them, this time knocking the glasses from the face of an elderly man in a three-piece suit. After the apologies, he continued.

“You were shoved into the Monbusho education system here,” Robby said, “And your first impulse was to get the hell out. But how many others followed you? How many really could? You, my friend, are a prime example of the exception proving the rule.”

And so for weeks they argued and fought like college roomies from different planets. Every conversation brought out as many seemingly irreconcilable conclusions as points of agreement. They explored the bleeding edge of pedagogy: constructionism, learning moments, and affective learning techniques. Ichiro introduced Robby to Yanagi Yuu, and the baths were a nightly event. Nothing like sitting naked in piping hot water to take the edge off an argument. Cooling down in the dressing room they often discovered an increment of understanding that would push them towards a new argument the following day.

Ichiro had rented Robby a small nineteenth-century machiya townhouse near the public bath. The residence of an Asian scholar from Paris, who was, this year, on sabbatical at  the University of Chicago, it was bitterly cold as the winter wind whistled through the shoji. A small kerosene space heater kept the main room livable. Robby seemed to appreciate the tatami and the tokonoma: the classical layout of the merchant house. After their bath they would often repair to the horikotatsu in Robby’s house and drink Momonoshizuku sake hot. The horikotatsu was a square cut out space in the tatami flooring, where they could dangle their feet near an electric heater.

Ichiro challenged Robby to try unfolding the templates for the liberation education teaching practices, but neither of them had any success at this. Then they were stuck for weeks trying to make a list of stuff every seventeen-year-old should know, but they decided that every seventeen-year-old should make her own list.

They did agree that a fundamental problem was the lack of literacy—not the basic ability to read, but the capacity to critically interrogate what one has read. Words, statistics, graphics, cinematic narratives, interactive games: none of these can be taken as presented.

Itchy would join the weekly teleconference and report their lack of progress. Finally, Scratchy exploded. He told Itchy that the two of them were simply “playing professor” with each other. “One of you has to play teacher and the other student, and then you need to grok the difference,” Scratchy said, sending Itchy back to Robby to try yet again.

Game Release + Eleven Months

Over the following weeks, Cindy had Nick do the reading exercises several times a day, scanning some graphics with a bunch of ziggly lines on them and a pointer that moved up and down and left and right. At first he was vocalizing the words that would appear and disappear in different parts of the screen. Then she had him turn up his microphone all the way and not vocalize the words.

The words were replaced by sentences, the sentences by paragraphs, and the paragraphs by pages. Cindy would ask him questions about the pages, and he found it easy to recall the information. They would work on this for an hour and spend the rest of the time doing the Queries, so he would finish the level. After a few weeks Cindy put up a series of pages, maybe a hundred of them and then started asking him questions.

“So what is the author’s position on New York City, and what are the differences between the city and the wealthy suburbs? Who is responsible for Gatsby’s death? What does the valley of the ashes symbolize?”

Nick answered these questions and Cindy showed him how completely full of shit his answers were. So he used some Free-for-All time she allowed him to query up some info about the history of New York and life in the 1920s Jazz age, modernist literature, class distinctions: wherever the Queries led.

After she was satisfied with his answers, he realized that he had read The Great Gatsby. It wasn’t so lame after all. They did a week of solid Queries and then he asked Cindy if he could read a little more Fitzgerald to get a better handle on the author. She showed him a map from his house to the Lompoc city library.

“They’ve got a full collection of Fitzgerald, and you can get out of the house. So piss off.” She shut down his computer.

“Fuck!” he hated when she did that.

He grabbed his deck and boarded over to the library, got a card, and found The Beautiful and the Damned, Tender is the Night, and All the Sad Young Men. He read these that Saturday afternoon down at the Red Star Coffee shop while his dad was at home watching the Mariners play the Yankees. After the last story, he dropped the books back at the library, went home for his surfboard, and paddled out into the rolling two-foot swells at Surf Beach. Everything he had just read began to crash back through his consciousness.

As he floated in the swells Nick’s eyes picked up whatever came into the range of his vision: a squadron of pelicans drifting south, a HumVee headed for Vandenberg, a trio of junior high girls in their thongs and tops walking across the beach. His mind was racing with a million thoughts about Fitzgerald’s world.

He spotted a young beauty doing her slow walk along the waterfront in her custom-fitted bikini. Usually he’d just get wood and enjoy the view, but today his mind glided back into the words he’d read.

Fitzgerald offered so many perceptions of women. Their best trick, he wrote, was to sit down and fold their hands. Like women were just going to wait for a man to do anything. Men, he claimed, are attracted to selfishness in women. Is that really true or just a literary conceit? “Conceit,” another word he had learned in the last week, one of thousands. If his brain were a Mac, he’d consider rebooting. The bikinied girl stepped into the water and jumped when a small wave found her thighs. At least, he consoled himself, he still got wood.

“Cindy,” he pleaded, later that day, “I’m magno-confused.”

She stood barefoot in her sexy teacher outfit and crossed her arms. “That’s because you thought the purpose of reading was to give you answers. Good literature provides answers. Great literature leaves only questions. I think you need to slow down, cowboy. No more than one book a day. It’s like a Chubby Burger, you don’t really want to eat more than one at a time.”

“My head feels like it’s TASERing itself.”

“Hmmm. Perhaps you need a week off.”

“After I earn my shoes.”

“You’re really close, and you finished all your homework. I want you to know you’ve made Cindy happy.”

“It’s about fucking time.” He perked up.

“Now, now.” She waved the wand menacingly. “Is that any way to talk to your teacher?”

“Well?”

“Well, what?”

“How happy are you?”

“You are such a horn doggy.”

“And you promised.”

“So I did.” Cindy put the wand back down on the desk behind her. She put her hands on this and leaned back. Then she stretched forward, and not one, but three of her shirt buttons jettisoned in ultra-slow motion and seemed to ping off the back of LCD screen. Her shirt opened out, revealing a deliciously thin, pink satin bra well stuffed, and, on her tummy a tattoo. It was a tat of his favorite deck, with his name on it.

“Take a good look, cowboy. You won’t be seeing these again.” She laughed and tousled her hair. Then her shirt and skirt morphed back into the Guide robe.

“Awwww,” he groaned. “That’s not fair.”

“Never claimed to be fair, Charlie. Actually, I’m a lot better than fair.”

“Tell me, Cindy, are you selfish?”

“Only every pixel of me,” she said.

“I find that very attractive in a woman.”

“You forget,” She morphed then into a humongous swampy creature with a alien-predator head, gleaming fangs and bright red claws. “I’m no woman.”

The next morning found Itchy and Robby walking down Kawaramachi-dori in a chill blustery wind. On the corner of Sanjo, two young women in pink hats and microskirts were passing out advertisements for a new lounge in Gion and risking frostbite on their labia.

“You’re a mathematician. Teach me some math today,” Itchy said, volunteering to do the student role. “I need to experience how the pedagogy works.”

“If you were a farmer, I’d start by asking you about your harvest and then weave mathematical notions around that.”

“If I were a farmer, I’d be able to sleep at night.”

“What’s keeping you up?”

“This damn house project. The plans are ready, the land is ready, the neighbors are ready, but I cannot get the city to work with me.”

“You’re satisfied with the plans.”

“It’s going to be the finest new shoin-style house built in Kyoto in fifty years.”

They occupied a corner table in a small, Euro-sutaeru kissaten coffee shop south of Shijo with free WiFi and nine-hundred yen lattes. Ichiro explained how a shoin style house was built with no nails. He took out his laptop and called up a Japanese website that diagrammed the various joints and tools used in traditional carpentry: the classical mortise and tenon, butterfly, swallowtail, and scarf joints.

Robby had a finite-element analysis visualization program on his laptop. He imported the computer-aided-design files for the joinery from the same Japanese site. Every time Ichiro finished explaining how a joint worked, Robby would create a set of mathematical problems that explored how the joint solved a particular problem of load bearing or tension. Changing the ratios of tongue and groove invariably weakened the joint. They ate a lunch of omorice and kept on working. When they had exhausted the material from the site, Robby challenged Ichiro to design a completely new joint for a hexagonal ring.

“Let’s say you want to make a Bucky dome out of wood and without nails,” he suggested, “So you can burn this on the Playa.”

Ichiro had to rewrite the finite element statements to adjust for the new angles and plug this into a modified mortis and tenon joint design. Within an hour they had a solution that would support a 24-foot dome made from two-by-two members. Robby ran it through the finite-element software, where they optimized the proportions.

“My brain hurts,” Ichiro said. Leaning back in his seat, he stretched and knocked over a latte on the table behind them. Robby shook his head and laughed as Ichiro went into his formal apologies.

“I’ll make a gaijin out of you yet,” he teased Ichiro. “Let’s get some air.”

They stumbled out into the darkness of the street and realized an entire day had passed. In silence they strode across the Shijo Bridge towards the Kabukiza, and they turned north through the bar-quarter of Gion to a small Korean restaurant near the Shirakawa.

Over beer, kimchi-buta-ramen, and yakiniku, they began to deconstruct the lessons of their session. Ichiro noted that his appreciation for the artistry of the carpentry was now buttressed by a mathematical understanding of its utility.

“I learned more math today than I learned in a semester at Reed.”

“Traditional crafts can optimize solutions through trial and error without mathematics,” Robby said. “I never realized. That’s the beauty of this pedagogy: the teacher learns as much as the student.”

“So what’s the trick?” Ichiro asked. “How do we build a learning system that captures what we just did?”

“I think we need to look at a whole new range of templates that subtend the content we normally try to solve using templates. We need to find a seed that unfolds the process of curiosity itself.”

“That’s all?” Ichiro said, shaking his head sadly. He wished Michael were here.

Game Release + Nine Months

For months Annaline had been teaching her many things,

including English, which Essie insisted she wanted to learn even though the Game could speak to her in her own language. The owner of the camp believed she was learning English from him, and was pleased with his skills, as she showed much improvement. Soon, he offered, she would be able to work sweeping out the Cuca shop.

Annaline was very strict with her and kept after her to think before she spoke. So many questions to ask, which was the right one? Before she earned her shoes, Annaline sat down by a fire and told her about the Game, about how it would change how she saw people and thought about her life.

“If you want to be a happy girl, you must put down the Game and go back to the village. Tell them you need to be cured, and then find a man who can make his fire with you. Get yourself a daughter. The Game will teach you so many new ideas. You will be more unhappy than you can imagine. Your people will not understand you.”

“My people despise me.”

“It’s not too late.”

“Teach me everything, Annaline. I must know enough to fly away from here, even if my body stays in this hut until I die.”

The 30-day limit was self-imposed, Ichiro admitted, but would result in certain consequences if progress were not forthcoming. He told Robby that the Nerds had all agreed that this was the fulcrum upon which they would leverage their action. Without it, they might as well close down and go home. The Nerds, Robby guessed, were the board that managed Ichiro’s company.

Ichiro and Robby had reached the end of their rope together; the words had all been said. After months of fruitless conversation they could hardly look at each other. No matter what approach they took, the template they required was beyond their means.

They had taken to squabbling over minutia: where to meet, where to sit, what to eat. They joked about becoming an old married couple in an Evelyn Waugh novel. Ichiro had some business in Vietnam, and Robby was happy to see him off. Perhaps a week apart would give them something new to talk about.

After what might just be their final breakfast, over at Hasegawa Coffee, Ichiro took the airport train to Kansai International, and Robby took his daypack and headed west across the city by foot. He had planned a day of drifting, a concerted, if random, searching about the city for clues to a puzzle he had no idea if he could solve.

Drifting was part art and part chance. Situationists in Paris in the 1960s used this as a means to uncover the social fabric of the city. Robby planned to wander through the Sanjo arcade and head toward the old Imperial Palace grounds. From there he might veer northwest through Kitano and Kinkakuji and then southwest over to Arashiyama and Tenryuji. Then again, he might end up anywhere. That was the point.

When he had discovered that their goal was to create an automated learning environment within a software game, Robby confessed to Ichiro that he was not sure automated learning was either possible or desirable.

“People need to teach one another,” he insisted. “It’s a social process.”

Ichiro showed him the alpha version of the Queries. Even at this rough stage, the ability to enter into a complex problem space and explore this fully in a day or less was remarkably instructive and great fun. It was like creating your own movie, mashing together video, graphics and audio in real time.

Ichiro explained that the Game was not just about templates, it was made with templates, and it worked through templates. In this the Game was far more organic than mechanical. They needed to find the learning logic that would inform the trajectory of the Game play through the lower levels. At the highest levels, the goal of the Game was simply to explore potential new templates.

“We can build the house but not the foundation. The learning path we are looking for must be emergent for each player. That’s why we hired you.”

In other words, put up or shut up. Fish or get off the boat. Unless he could unfold a universal template for learning Robby would be back in Brazil within a month. He drifted past the Museum of Kyoto, where they had constructed an historical market street. With its retail gradients and personable scale, the street was an architectural template treasure trove. Nearly all of the actual old market streets had been destroyed in the Post-War building boom. Much of the drifting ahead of Robby would be through grim concrete and steel buildings pushed to the edge of streets, blindly inhospitable to the pedestrian.

Glancing up at the bland facades of the four-story gray buildings, he wondered if there were a street in Kyoto where none of the architectural templates from the old market street applied, an inversion of everything that makes a street friendly and useable. This gave his drifting a new focus, and he wandered south on a side street near Karasuma. He thought he’d found the street when he noticed that some resident of a third floor apartment had repaired her meager metal balcony with flowering planter boxes. He wandered on.

He had almost reached the main train station when he turned the corner to a side street that made him stop. Originally a narrow lane, the street had a row of steel-reinforced concrete power poles on one side and small trucks and cars parked against the other, leaving only enough passage for a skilled taxi driver in a small Toyota. All of the buildings had been rebuilt to the edge of the street out of stucco-covered board tacked over steel frames. Thin metal casement window frames punctuated the gray walls. Tangles of wires led from the buildings on either side to the poles in the street. Pedestrians ducked in and out of the poles. Not a template to be seen: the street was simply hideous.

He stood there on the corner, transfixed by the ugliness in front of him, marveling that the same culture that created the old market street would later build such a place. Had they learned nothing? A small notion nibbled at the edges of his imagination. Somehow the templates for streets had been unlearned, lost in only a few generations. Or was this negative street, this inversion of the logic of the old market street, built through an entirely different intention?

“All this was intentional,” he whispered to himself. Not just intentional, intention-full. It’s all intention-full, he mused.

Once he saw the street as intention-full, he began to notice that, despite its narrow confines, which extended from the street to the narrowness of each lot, an amazing amount of activity had been made possible by maximizing the size of the buildings. Garage spaces built underneath the structures had been transformed into mini-factories. Their open fronts allowed the transfer of large loads. Offices took the stories above, with apartments on the top floor.

He wandered into the lane. Every building was a hive of activity; machines whirred and chunked, cranked out bushings and gears or printed fliers or manuals. Workers tooled steel on lathes, bundled boxes for delivery, or sipped tea from large vacuum bottles, chatting in their breaks.

The very ugliness of the buildings made them more useable. Workers had attached machinery to floors and walls, tacked up notice boards and signs, and appropriated the spaces with an informality that would have violated a highly designed space. The trucks and cars parked on the side were mostly in the process of delivering or picking up goods: a motorized ballet for the just-in-time delivery of subassemblies to other factories. Around the far corner another street was filled with ramen shops, hundred-yen stores, and food stalls for the workers.

Robby turned back and watched the street perform its daily commercial symphony. He knew in that instant why they had failed to find the template for education. They were focused on curiosity while the answer was intention.

Education must be intention-full. This would be his seed. Provide the right intention and curiosity will take over from there. Robby drifted north again, up through the Palace grounds, then west through Ichijoji to the Nishijin district. For a good part of the afternoon he was lost in time and space and thought.

He followed a battalion of junior-high students to the gates of the Kinkakuji pavilion and cut over through the campus of Ritsumeikan University, down into western Kyoto toward the Arashiyama. He lunched standing up on soba, and he barely noticed a rain squall as he descended to the Katsura River. Every step he took was filled with intention even when it lacked a fixed direction.

“Intention Becomes Practice.” The templates were jumping out at him as they unfolded. “Practice takes Discipline.” He had no idea how these templates would be programmed into software. That was someone else’s job. Building intention into education, exposing the intention of the learning moment. “Discipline Reveals the Logic of Practice.” The templates clicked into place in his mind.

He found himself at the gate of Tenryuji Temple, paid the 500 yen admission fee, and took the path around the temple’s pond. He hardly noticed the buildings and the elaborate gardens. The entire problem space for learning opened up before him, as he strolled among the manicured foliage. He found a bench, pulled his stack of blank three-by-five cards from his pack, and began to capture his thoughts on paper, as though these were a flock of birds about to fly off to nearby Mt. Ogura.
