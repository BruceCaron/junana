# Thirteen
Jennifer reread a report from her assistants about the game in Junana. Both of them were capable researchers with doctorates from top universities, and so she had little reason to doubt their analysis. However their joint report was incredibly unprofessional, it basically told her to play the Game herself, as soon as possible, and to ask Claire to have the entire staff do the same. They had finished Level Three, whatever that meant, in three months of nearly constant play, and were starting Level Four.

After leaving still-unanswered messages on their phones and emails, Jennifer sent an urgent message to their home pages on Junana for a meeting at the Sorbonne scene the next morning. She was furious with them.

Roland and Annika’s avatars were waiting for her at the appointed time under the meeting tree in the Sorbonne quadrangle, which looked nothing like anything at the Sorbonne. They each wore the brown shoes and black hat she had seen popping up in Junana, and which had also appeared, like mushrooms after a spring shower, on the sidewalks of Paris. They walked over to a reasonably vacant arcade. Roland’s avatar wore a sweatshirt that read “Y.U.” Annika’s was in jeans and a simple white blouse. They switched to a private encrypted conversation mode. Jennifer toggled to Third Person and hovered over the shoulder of her avatar.

“I’ve been trying to contact you for weeks. I need one reason why I should not fire you right now,” Jennifer said. Her avatar analyzed the meaning of the words and placed its hands on its hips in irritation.

“Well, for starters, we are neck deep in the biggest thing to hit the Internet since porn,” Annika said.

“I told you to investigate, not go completely native,” Jennifer said. “You stopped answering my emails.”

“Once I got plugged in,” Roland confessed, “I lost track of time.”

“The Game is truly addictive,” Annika said.

“In a completely engaging fashion,” Roland added, “Like the best movie you’ve ever seen, or the finest lecture you’ve ever attended.”

“Then your report was grossly incomplete.”

“The Game is not easy to describe. For one thing, it plays differently for each user.”

“We compared our experiences in the first two levels,” Annika said, “Apart from the underlying context, they were almost entirely different.”

“The first level,” Roland started, “Seems more like a personality test than a game. Level one presents you with a stream of challenges that reveal your thought processes, your fascinations and irritations...”

“What you avoid and crave,” Annika continued. “How you react, what you already know. Most players would not guess that the Game is playing them.”

“That’s what got us intrigued. This is far more sophisticated than any other computer game we’ve played. Take the Guide, for example.” Roland’s avatar smiled, almost unconsciously. “My Guide was just like this upper-class man I met at Oxford when I was a freshman.”

“Mine was like the tennis coach I had in high school.” Annika said. “Part parent, part movie star...”

“Part best friend, part lover...”

“Part Yoda, part Buffy...”

“All knowing, you can ask him anything...”

“And tell her everything,” Annika added. “And, eventually, you do.”

“Like I said, the Game starts as a confessional, which seems to be a necessary procedure for the Game to prepare its programming for the following layers—”

Nearby, in the center of the quadrangle, an avatar appeared. He was wearing the shoes and the hat, and a long crimson cloak over a Tibetan yellow shirt, with a blue shoulder bag. He was holding a long wooden staff as tall as he was. Annika saw him in the corner of her vision and turned, Roland followed her gaze.

“The Grand Meister,” he whispered and nodded in the avatar’s direction. From the crowd of avatars in the quadrangle several of them, each with a blue shoulder bag, began to converge on the new arrival. Most of the others were still watching from where they stood.

“What is going on?” Jennifer asked. “Who is that?”

“He has completed the Seventh Level and is immersed in the templates,” Annika spoke. “I’d heard rumors that the first Grand Meister had emerged. I never expected to see him.”

The Grand Meister raised one hand in a salute or a benediction. Annika and Roland joined the crowd in a return bow. Then he and the blue-bag-wearing avatars surrounding him disappeared.

“Was that a Guide or a real person?” Jennifer asked.

“Definitely a person, someone I would hope to meet,” Annika said. “When I’m worthy.”

“Worthy? You have a Ph.D. from Stockholm University and you feel inadequate to meet someone who has mastered a video game?”

“The Game is not Counter Strike,” Roland said, his avatar gesturing as the rant developed. “It’s not like any other computer game you can imagine. It’s not Halo, EverQuest, or World of Warcraft. It’s an accelerator hooked up to your brain, a window onto the features of actual life that subtend your everyday existence. And when you leave the Game, you see everything differently. The singular design of your room, the habits of your family, the news programs: nothing remains the same as before.”

“Do you remember the conversation you had with your friends in school where you first announced that you doubted God’s existence?” Annika added. “By announcing this you opened up the possibility that God actually did not exist, and freed yourself from the need to feel he must. That moment is really when you move from your childhood wondering about God to the possibility of actively believing in God, or to rejecting this belief. The act of belief requires this moment of doubt.

“That moment, or rather its like, is repeated many times in the Game. You can feel the revelations pull out the stops in your thinking, yank away the hobbles from your emotions. So many times I’ve been exploring topics I thought I had mastered: core issues about power, identity, and action I’d been reading and writing about for years.

“The Game challenges me to show my understanding. It shines a light on the clear relief of my ignorance. Then it guides me to a new understanding. Suddenly I am freed from the fear that what I’ve learned and what I know is just some mod pastiche of other people’s words. For the first time in my life I feel so incredibly grounded in what I know I know.”

“Wait!” Jennifer yelled, and her avatar threw up its hands. “You are talking about a computer game—something manufactured to pull cash out of the accounts of kiddies and their parents. Clever eye candy for the attention-challenged; and you tell me it’s changing your lives?

“Right now there are more than 900 million players,” Roland said.

“By this time next year there could be two billion,” Annika continued.

“That would mean just about everyone on the planet who has access to a computer would have at least tried the Game,” Jennifer said.

Both of her employees were smiling broadly.

“And you figured maybe I wouldn’t want to be the last one to check it out. OK, so you’re not fired. But please, go to a movie, drift around the city. Turn off your computers and eat dinner in a restaurant.”

“Right, boss,” Roland said and logged off.

“My Guide just told me there is a Bergman retrospective at the Kino,” Annika said. “She agrees completely with you. Ciao!” She logged off.

Jennifer used the menu to get back to the initial screen for the Junana client. She was in a Romanesque anteroom with two doors. One was marked “Junana,” the other, “Game.”

She touched the doorknob on the door marked “Game” and the scene faded.

Both of the Bishop twins received Wanda’s farewell kiss and their shoes before the summer break. Simon insisted that Wanda was the shit, but Peter knew better. Tits are one thing, he’d say, and Simon would remind them they are actually two things. Anyhow, Peter offered, Wanda is old, could be like nineteen, and she’s probably humping Jorge every chance she gets.

The shoes they hid in their closets. Word of the Game had spread around the campus and the Rector had put out a warning that any student caught playing the Game would be punished. Not that he would even consider punishing Simon or Peter. Rector Hector flinched every time Simon said hello to him. Several students who were careless enough to log on while in the Computer Center now spent weekends in detention. Teachers were even required to report students caught doing the Brainwave exercises in class. Peter claimed he spied Miss Jeffreys doing them in her car in the parking lot.

That summer they were back in California, at their dad’s new mansion in Newport Beach. Their mom, they were told, was recovering from a nervous condition that required her to stay in their old house back in San Antonio to be close to her doctor. Their father voyaged off on another of his around-the-world UCCC fundraisers for most of the summer, preaching from a different country every week. This left the boys in the care of a rotation of church functionaries who made sure they brushed their teeth and did not drown in the pool.

They devoted the whole summer to the Game. They played each day until their Guides shut down the Game and told them to go eat. Then they drifted through the ever expanding maze of scenes on Junana, marveling and scoffing at the people they met. Simon used the pool only once. After an all-day query, he walked outside and took a piss in it.

Courtney, realizing Peter’s fascination with anime, promised to take him on a virtual tour of Tokyo, once he got through Level Three. Eldrick finally offered Simon the barest of compliments. This sent him into an ecstatic fugue for a whole day. Simon cruised through Level Three and was nearly done with Level Four when school started again. The twins were now straight “A” students, a significant improvement for Simon, who had always maintained a “C” average as a posture against his father’s expectations.

§ § §

The rector express-mailed their fall-quarter grades back to California with a note of praise for the Bishop twins. The content of this note reflected glory back on the school with some spill over on his own performance. Actually most of the boys were doing better in their academic classes, although their behavior in chapel and in their required religious instruction was not improving. Quite the reverse, he mused.

Rector Ralph H. Lovemark taught all of the religious instruction classes. He had seen his share of adolescent hijinks and outright bad behavior in his day. That his middle name was Hector gave the students some little pleasure to abuse.

“Rector Hector,” they’d ask, “if the world is less than seven thousand years old, how did those dinosaur bones get buried in the rock?” God’s plan for the Earth was not theirs to understand; this was his answer to most of their questions. Maybe his answers were not entirely satisfactory, but wasn’t that where faith came in?

In the last few months, he faced a barrage of entirely new questions, many of them challenging the very premise of doctrine. It was as though the boys had gone to another school in their sleep and had returned with poisonous suspicions and highly unorthodox perspectives.

Little Simon Bishop had failed his interview at the Orange County kindergarten when he bit a little girl on the arm during the “sociability” test. She had been attracted to his eyes, which were delightfully green hazel. She had touched his cheek. His brother Peter told his dad that Simon was just grumpy that afternoon. Simon said he thought the girl was going to poke out his eyes.

“Rector Hector?” Simon stood up in the classroom. He trained the same brace of emerald hazel eyes on Ralph. “So, exactly what were you in your most recent past life?”

The Nerds celebrated the first year of the Game in cities around the world. Desi had returned to India. Itchy was back in Kyoto. Winston was in Philly, Jack in Rome, and Scratchy in Santa Barbara. Desi had suggested that they spend a day drifting and then gather in the Room at midnight Zulu time to report what they had seen.

They had fixed the Room design to resemble a nineteenth-century London club, culling the best elements of a Ruskinian gothic chapel and a corner pub: carved walnut wall panels, a plush burgundy carpet, an enormous cut stone fireplace, gas lamps on the walls, and a vaulted ceiling. Incongruously, the huge console screen took up an entire side wall and the Cordobaloungers were arranged in a semicircle in front of the fireplace.

“We’ve delivered over a 100 million pairs of shoes, more than 8 million hats, and almost 1 million shoulder bags worldwide,” Jack reported.

“It’s like the world has paused and is waiting,” Itchy said. “But it doesn’t yet know for what.”

“What does a post-consumer world look like?” Winston asked.

“Stick around and we’ll all find out,” Scratchy said.

“So far, it’s just sad—I mean, all those stores closing down,” Desi sighed.

“Global energy consumption is way down too,” Jack said. “The global economy has, in effect, shifted into neutral.”

“Where will it go from here?” Desi asked.

“Exactly,” said Jack.

“That was a question,” said Desi.

“And now the world has a reason to ask such questions and the time to consider some answers. Democracy runs well behind the pace of the marketplace. We gave it the opportunity to catch up.”

“That’s not our problem,” Scratchy reminded him.

“No more than it’s everybody’s problem,” Winston added.

“Sometimes you travel farthest by just standing still,” Desi said.

“Sounds like you’ve unfolded one too many templates,” said Scratchy.

“I can’t say how the Game has affected anybody else, but I feel like I’m swimming in an immense ocean of history and knowledge,” said Desi.

“Anyhow, year is up,” Scratchy noted. “Time to go public with the template code.”

“Are you sure you want to go through with that?” Jack asked. “You don’t know what the response will be.”

“It’s computer code. One or more nerds might get excited for a week,” Scratchy said.

“It’s going to be big,” Desi predicted. “Look what we’ve managed to do in just a few years.”

“I’ve got to clean up the comments before I release it. So it’ll be several more days. I’ve got a lot of work to do.” Scratchy logged off, his avatar disappearing from the Cordobalounger.

“This is going to get interesting real soon,” Itchy said.

“Ramen, brother!” Desi said.

“Can’t we stop him?” Winston asked.

“Not when he’s right,” Jack said. “It’s one of those traits you love and hate about the man.”

“So, you’ve noticed,” Desi said. “Mikey’d rather go down with the ship, so it’s up to us to keep the ship afloat.”

“This year we’d better all be prepared to watch each other’s back. I’ll see what I can do to get some support for Michael, should things go crazy this weekend. Ciao.” Jack’s avatar disappeared.

“See you back in Sao Do, Itchy. Ta-ta, Winston.” Desi’s avatar disappeared. Winston and Itchy logged out and the room faded to white.

Desi had made a practice of gathering Fivers for discussions about the Game. He would enter a plaza, broadcast a voice message that only Fivers in the plaza would hear, and invite them to join him in a discussion space Itchy had set up for this purpose. Desi wanted to know their impressions about how the Game was working in their lives.

Through these conversations Desi discovered a growing intolerance among players for non-players, as well as a rise in cynicism and depression within the Game community. The Game experience not only made its players smarter, as they had planned, but also impacted their willingness to cope with the problems they still faced at home or at work. They were becoming more self-reliant but also more introverted. There was increasing disenchantment with everyday activities and mundane cultural practices. Outside of the Game they were bored out of their skulls.

When Desi described these effects to the Nerds at their next Room session, they were discounted as temporary. After all the Game was just a year old. People would need time to adjust to their new capacities. Once Gamers started making movies and writing books a new aesthetic would emerge that could engage the players more fully.

“Out with the old,” Scratchy said. “In with the new. Give it time. This is happening much quicker than we expected.”

“Nobody’s unfolded the happiness template,” Winston reminded him. It was a theme they returned to again and again.

“We could try to add some fun to the Game,” Desi said. “Fivers are way too serious.”

Itchy proposed that they add Free-for-All time to the Game in Level Three.

“Players are banging their heads against a template every time they log on. We need to give them space to explore topics they choose.”

In Level Four, the Guide already offered Free-for-All time as a reward. In level Five players can call up Free-for-All time as much as they want. At that point the Game became a universal digital library, encyclopedic in scope and tailored to the desires and capacities of each player.

Jack had suggested that the Game interface with the resources at local public libraries, instead of offering the same content online. Desi programmed the Game to scan the online catalogs of libraries around the world. When a Query or Free-for-All noted a certain book, the Guides directed players to their local library.

“Have you walked through a public library lately?” Winston asked. “Players are speed reading books at the stacks. They don’t even check them out.”

“I noticed kids speed reading over at Chaucer’s Books here in Santa Barbara the other day,” Scratchy said. “The owner finally shooed them out the door.”

After a week of mounting chaos, they moved the Friday meeting out of the Santa Barbara High School faculty lounge into the front of the auditorium. In every classroom, teachers struggled to keep up with a cadre of student who appeared to command more content and who reveled in asking more questions than any students they had ever taught. The teachers were at turns thrilled, humbled, amazed, frightened, and totally at a loss about how to keep the class to their lesson plans. The other students, the ones that still acted like high-school students, complained acidly or sank into silent dread as the class spiraled beyond their comprehension.

All 74 teachers showed up, with all the counselors and front office staff. Phil Quigley sat on the stage, his legs dangling. He wore the hat. Principal Jason Woods sat quietly, dazed by the events of the day. During lunch Phil and a small delegation of teachers had confronted him in his office, outlining a project they said would take the full cooperation of the school’s administration. It was, they added, the only way forward out of chaos in the classroom.

A group of the faculty sat off on the left side of the auditorium. Several of them also wore the hats. They whispered calmly among themselves. The rest of the faculty were in animated discussions, gesturing frantically and paying Phil little attention. He stood up and clapped his hands several times to get them to listen. The room finally quieted.

“Today,” Phil said, “is the first day of the rest of your career.” He let this sink in. “Our students have been given access to a teaching environment light years ahead of our classrooms.” The group on the left was nodding quietly. “With this tool they can cover the same content we have been teaching them in roughly one tenth of the time and with near perfect recall.”

“Looks like early retirement!” someone shouted. A nervous laugh faded quickly.

“Several months ago a new Game appeared online. Within weeks...,” he consulted his notes, “roughly a quarter of Santa Barbara High School students were playing. That figure is now more than 62 percent.”

A few weeks ago his Guide, Natalie, had interrupted his Free-for-All time to inform him that he was the most advanced player among the faculty and staff at Santa Barbara High. She showed him a video about what might happen on the first day of school and he read several white papers about the teaching goals and methods of the Game and how these could be integrated into a school-wide program. Natalie was excited that he would be leading the effort.

“Today we are witnessing the biggest wave of learning this planet has ever seen.” Phil picked one of the themes from the video. “We can either stand up and ride this wave, or we can lie down and let it crush us on the rocks. It’s all explained in this whitepaper.” He passed a sheaf of handouts to the nearest teacher to distribute.

Beth, the librarian, jumped up. “I saw Mike Lockerbie read a whole book in half an hour. Stranger in a Strange Land. Cover to cover. During lunch. Didn’t even check it out.” She slumped back in her chair.

“Thank you, Beth,” Phil said. “An excellent example of what I’m getting at. One of the problems we face is a dramatic increase in drop-ups.”

“You mean drop-outs,” someone said.

“I mean,” he answered, “drop-ups. The day they turn sixteen, students are taking the on-line state high-school equivalency test and getting their diploma. They are ‘dropping up’ and going to City College instead of Santa Barbara High School. Easiest thing in the world, once you have one of these.” He held up a Bachelor of Knowledge diploma from Yanagi University while he looked back at his notes.

“As of yesterday, 276 SBHS students have already earned their first university degree. Another 500 or so are close. More than a hundred students have already dropped up and will not be back this semester.

“We need to keep our students here, in school, until they are seventeen. That’s our first goal. And we need to get our entire faculty through Level Three on the Game. There are new teaching templates on Level Four. That’s our next goal. By the time you have your hat,” he doffed his and resettled it on his head. “You will wonder how you ever stood in front of a classroom before the Game.”

“Are you suggesting we allow students to play a video game in school?” Gary Trumble called out.

“I am suggesting that we all play the Game as our curriculum. If Mike Lockerbie can read a whole book in half an hour, can you imagine how much he can learn in a semester? We need to bring the Game to the rest of the students and give them time to explore it during school. We have plenty of computers, so let’s put them to good use.”

“How do we explain to their parents that they are playing a computer game all day?” Principal Woods asked.

“If we agree to open up the school to the Game, then the Game will agree to become an official school resource. For our students, the Game will re-skin its interface to become the ‘Santa Barbara High School Knowledge Assistant.’ Homework assignments and required readings will be handled through this ‘KayAye.’ In return, the Game will encourage its more advanced players to come to school each day instead of dropping up.”

“What do you mean, ‘the Game will agree’?” Trumble yelled, standing up, pointing his finger at Phil. “Who built this?”

“The handout covers the pedagogical vision for the Game. There is a complete teacher in-service course on Level Three, and we have a teacher’s lounge area in Junana where we can discuss these issues.”

“And if we don’t agree?” Trumble asked.

“Most of our students will drop up as soon as they can. Until then they will come to class knowing more about the topic of the day than you do.” Phil slipped back into his seat.

“What about the rest of the students? What if they don’t want to play the Game?” Amanda Baxter asked.

“No student will be forced to use the KayAye. We will continue to teach the standard curriculum in small classes without Gamers present.”

“What do we say to the school board?” Principal Woods asked.

“We are still teaching to the tests,” He glanced over at the Gamer teachers, “with some more advanced content.”

“If we agree, then the Game predicts that our students will...” he glanced at his notes, “score on average at least 40 percent higher than last year in the required tests. At least half the students will get one or more 5s on AP tests.”

“Forty percent!” Principal Woods exclaimed. And if we don’t jump on board, he thought, every other high school in the district will outscore us.

Amanda Baxter stood up. “I assigned The Great Gatsby for summer reading. Nick Landreu is in my sophomore literature class. Those of you who teach freshman classes might remember Nick. Others might remember the incident at the flagpole last year.”

She paused. Several teachers and staff members were nodding.

“Over the summer, Nick not only read The Great Gatsby, but as far as I can tell, he read everything Fitzgerald wrote, and several other authors from the period. On his own initiative.”

She lowered her head.

“I should be thrilled, and I am. More than anything.” She looked up at Phil. “I need the tools to work with these kids. I don’t want to just keep up with them. I want to step up and engage them. If this game will help, I’m ready to try it.”

Principal Woods stood up and walked over to the stage. He boosted himself up on this and stood beside Phil.

“I know this is coming at us way too fast,” he said. “But maybe that’s the way it needs to happen. I could make the decision alone, but I think we’ll need to help each other through this, so I’m going to open this up to a vote. I’m going to assume the faculty sitting over there,” he pointed to the left, “will vote ‘yes,’ meaning you’re in favor of this new game. The rest of you, including staff, grab a slip of paper and write ‘yes’ or ‘no’ on this, fold it and pass it to the aisle. Martha, can you pick these up?”

Martha, his assistant, stood up and nodded. The vote took only a minute. She gathered the slips and handed them up to Woods. He sorted them on the stage. Then he stood and faced them.

“Well, it’s pretty clear. Only nine ‘no’ votes. Does anybody have anything they want to say?”

Gary Trumble stood up. “I’m still bothered by the secrecy behind this game scheme. I can’t argue with its effectiveness, but I would feel a lot better if the designers were available for a conversation. How do we know where all this is headed?”

“Phil,” Woods said. “What if we later decide to opt out of this arrangement?”

Phil had forgotten to tell them this point. “Principal Woods will have complete authority over if and how the Game is used on campus. His Guide will be providing detailed reports on student progress and any issues that teachers have. He can literally pull the plug at any time, and the Game will immediately become inactive on campus computers.”

“Says you,” Trumble said.

“Says me,” Phil agreed.

Woods sorted through the layers of emotion that had enveloped him all day. For years his main task had been to keep his best teachers from giving up out of exhaustion and frustration. Suddenly, students who formerly graced his office with flimsy excuses for bonehead pranks were actually doing the summer required reading. Half his teachers felt unqualified to step back into their classrooms. He strode to the edge of the stage and held up his hands.

“On Monday, we will open up the Knowledge Assistant as a new tool for all our students. Those who have their own laptop computers will be encouraged to bring them. The rest will have school computers made available to them. Students who decide not to use the KayAye. will have class time as before and cover the required topics. The same goes for the teachers. Nobody will be forced to use this new Knowledge Assistant. This is a voluntary experiment in digital learning. We will meet again next Friday to discuss progress and problems. My office door is open all the time for any concerns that arise. Now take a deep breath, go home, and have a relaxing weekend. Come Monday we’ll all go back to school.”
