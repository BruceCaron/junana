# Seven
Scratchy felt more like a composer or a novelist than a programmer these days. Months before, he had updated an open-source integrated development environment to handle the templates. He called this IDE “Total Eclipse” or TE. He showed this to Desi, who disappeared from the world for a week and came back with a UML 5.0 type specification for all the templates, so that entire feature structures could be visually modeled.

Winston had set up a shell company, WeRus NV, in Belgium, that hired Scratchy as a technical lead on Junana administration with an expense account for staff, R&D, and equipment. WeRus NV also had a contract with the Sao Do Group in Vietnam. Scratchy would scope out the various features that needed to be built into the Junana client or server and then map these into their initial states and output parameters. He would send these to his programmer teams in Sao Do.

Scratchy built the test harnesses himself and ran all the automated tests on the XServe array computer at the WeRus facility in Goleta. He had a hardware and OS simulator that could run the client virtually on chips as old as the first Intel dual core CPUs and on Windows XP or OSX Panther. Each day, Scratchy would get code back from Sao Do and plug this into his own test harness, test the whole code stack overnight, and then send out new feature specifications. He was building in a few additional features, such as network hacks that would create no end of excitement in enterprise installations.

Nobody knew network protocols, communications, and security better than Scratchy. His life and his fortune had been spent and earned in this arena. So he made a communications link between the client and the mesh that would simply bypass any currently existing firewall, opening up a port that the computer didn’t even know it had. He built in native SCTP-2 protocol support and tuned the entire system to optimize through the global Ariadne backbone. He also made the program self-installing on any network. Once downloaded to any one computer on a LAN, the client would install and run on all the computers on the LAN. He imagined the fun they were going to have at the Pentagon.

Game Release + Eight Months

Nick watched the screen saver morph through a montage of outstanding rollers. He was doing the brainwave thing, opening up the doorway to his memory. He held a vision of Wanda smiling at him, and then of Cindy, who would be waiting for him in her robes. Cindy was the clever one, always ahead of the pack, sidestepping the spears that were aimed at Nick’s heart. This level wasn’t any easier than the last one, even without the slime monsters and the fairyland pixies. All that, he realized, was just the candy they used so he would stay interested until it was too late to go back. Too late, that is, to actually want to go back. Wanting was something completely new for him, wanting in this “gotta know everything now” way.

Nick could not decide if he was disenchanted with his life or enchanted with the Game, which, he figured, was his life, since he spent pretty much every waking minute in it. Last week, his mom got upset with him on the computer all the time. She thought he was watching porn and made him keep his door open. She was working two jobs and not around much. So he could have been up to his pubes in porn most of the day, door open or shut. Maybe the Game was some kind of mental porn. He’d have to mention that to Cindy.

Cindy would give him a surf report or mention that a friend of his was down at the Red Star Coffee Shop. She would shut down the computer if he tried to skip school to play. But he had almost earned his shoes, and he didn’t want to go out until he could wear them around.

Last week he saw Jackie Kim wearing the shoes down on State Street. They never talked at school, not for years. She was this straight arrow, straight ‘A,’ college preppy Asian girl. He was slack, riding his deck, strictly back of the classroom. She was surprised when he told her he was Gaming. She thought her Guide was the shit, but she’d never met Cindy. Now he and Jackie are friends on Junana. She turned sixteen in July and tested out, so she won’t be back at Santa Barbara High. He has to wait for the spring, which means almost a whole year of classes before he can take the test. What an absolute ass-waste of time.

Jackie would taking courses at City College in the fall because her parents told her to. She said she would be applying to Harvard, “just like every other Korean in California.” She told him Level Three was a full-blown biotch. In her new picture on Junana she wears a Yanagi U hoodie and looks so very serious he told her she should snag some laughs. Not that Level Two was cutting him any kind of slack.

“I found a chief sys-admin, hired him as a CIO for one of these dummy companies Winston set up. I explained that we had a contract with the owners of Junana.com,” Scratchy announced to the teleconference. “He’s got a long resume and he can type. His name is Donald Driscoll. He started at Bell Labs in the early ‘80s and did a decade in Sunnyvale before the company got flushed by the dot-com bust. He was CIO for a Cal State campus up north. I relocated him here in Goleta, near where I’ve set up an office. I’m paying too much for him to get real curious, and he can hire assistants for the other shifts.”

“Now I can get some sleep.” Desi had been filling in on network duty.

“Adding new technical people is a dangerous move,” Jack said.

“Choose the wrong guy, and things can go sideways,” Winston reminded them. “It’s like playing the wrong ball.”

“Or listening to the wrong caddy,” Itchy said.

“Or hitting the wrong green,” Scratchy added.

“Or picking the wrong club,” Desi noted.

“Enough!” Winston said.

“You started it, Ricky,” Desi said. “We’ve warned you about that.” They refused to let Winston get away with golfing metaphors.

Winston Logan Fairchild grew up playing Spring Hill with his uncles, cousins, and assorted well-heeled strangers. The Philadelphia Country Club was the only place his mother would let him be on his own. The chauffeur would drop him off after school or early on the weekends, and he would malinger as long as possible. On numerous occasions, his mother would call to say he should take dinner there.

For years, golf was better to him (and for him) than all of his nannies, many of his girl friends, and either of his parents. The country club was his playground. After all, his prep school never had soon-to-be-divorced ex-debutantes looped on gimlets and Valium, looking for someone to get frisky with in the backseat of a Bentley. And the golf was a personal challenge, something he got very good at early on, before he know how clever he was at other things. Golf was something he would never be as good at as he wanted to be.

“Let me suggest something,” Jack said. “Each of us will need to add top staff as we move forward. None of these staff members should be aware that the five of us are working together. I will also suggest that the five of us no longer meet at all, except in a private room on Junana.com.”

“Goodbye Nerdfests.” Scratchy lamented.

“A private room?” Winston asked.

“Jack asked me to put one together,” Itchy answered. “It’s accessible from the central plazas, but only to us. Here’s how it works. I assumed none of us would visit a goth scene by choice...”

“The goth scenes,” Desi said. “Have you been? Each of of them in twenty-three shades of gray. Oh, my God, it’s so depressing.”

“Since none of us wants to hang in any of the thousand or so goth scenes, whenever any of us steps into a goth scene transporter anywhere,” Itchy continued, “we will be diverted to the Room. At the same time, a copy of our avatar will actually arrive at a scene and lurk around looking bored and depressed for several minutes before appearing to log out.”

“Thereby simulating actual scene behavior,” Winston noted.

“This way,” Jack said, “we will coordinate our efforts without ever meeting in person.”

“Look behind you before you step into the transporter. If there’s someone there, let them go ahead and wait a minute before stepping in. I cannot turn off the repeat function,” Itchy reminded them.

Gamers normally used menus to get to the scene of their choice. Scratchy insisted that simulating transport in the plazas helped maintain verisimilitude.

“Motion is the central metaphor of modernity,” he noted.

Transporters randomly distribute individuals to balance crowding in any one scene. They are programmed to stay active to the same scene as long as a group of avatars keep entering. It is not unusual to see several avatars striding into the light column in rapid succession, like Beatles crossing Abbey Road. Anyone who stopped the flow for more than the latency period of the transporter would end up in a different show—along with all those behind her—and new title: “slackass,” as in “that slackass biotch sent us to this lame show.”

The transporters looked like columns of pale silver light shining up from the pavement. The light column also called out its destination, which Desi’s language software translated into all the languages of the avatars in the vicinity. A floating brass railing one meter from the pavement kept people from accidentally stumbling into the transporter from the back. On one side of the column the railing opened up to a gate, and when you stepped into the light you would find yourself at your destination.

“The Room has no label on any menu. This is the only way we can get there,” Itchy said.

As one of Jack’s security measures, the five of them were the only Junana users with totally made up names, profiles, and avatars. Desi’s latest avatar looked a lot like Jude Law. Jack’s sounded like Walter Winchell, but looked more like Hoagy Carmichael. Winston’s used a modified Ben Hogan photo with a retro haircut, broad cream-colored pants and a checked sweater. Itchy went Western: a working cowboy attire and a Texas accent. Scratchy holographed a face out of a book of Sing Sing death row inmates from the ‘50s, and dressed an average weight/height/age body in jeans and a white t-shirt. He made its voice sound like Leonard Cohen’s.

“Why are we being so careful?” Itchy asked. “We’re not doing anything illegal.”

“We’re planning to do something interesting. And, like comedy, that’s a whole lot more dangerous than just illegal,” Scratchy said.

“One of the unintended consequences of capitalism is that it produces a population optimized for consumption,” Jack started.

“Stupid enough to buy all that crap,” Scratchy cut in.

“More than that,” Winston said. “Dependent on service industries and expert systems for almost everything but respiration.”

“I think Ronco is working on that now,” Itchy said, “’The remarkable Breath-o-matic.’”

“Addicted to fashion as a primary defense mechanism for their egos,” Jack continued.

“All symptoms of late stage ‘affluenza,’” noted Scratchy. “A goddam epidemic.’”

“And we are looking to take this population and move it years ahead of the companies that now supply its every need,” Jack concluded.

“We are going to push the public past the publicity,” Winston said. “People are going to be thinking for themselves for once.”

“Well...” Desi started. The line went quiet as they waited. “I mean...” He hesitated.

“We’re all friends here,” Winston said.

“The thing is, I actually really like capitalism. Fashion, restaurants, I guess pretty much everything. I mean, now that we are, I mean, each of us is...”

“...filthy rich?” Scratchy suggested.

“We go around destroying capitalism...” Desi said.

“Who said we were destroying anything? We are simply going to make capitalism sing for its supper,” Jack said.

“We are going to make it stand up and bark,” Itchy added.

“And turn over a new leaf,” Winston added.

“You mean we’re just helping capitalism live up to its promise?” Desi never subscribed to the idea that capitalism was just another form of colonialism.

“That’s a fact,” Scratchy said.

“And save the world in the process,” noted Winston.

“And impoverish most of the parasites that currently run the show,” added Itchy.

“That’s a bonus,” Jack said, before Scratchy could.

Game Release + Ten Months

Nick double-clicked the Junana Game application. Cindy, in her robes, appeared in a room that looked nothing like the Game space where he’d left her. In fact it looked quite a bit like a classroom at Santa Barbara High. She was standing in front of a desk, and behind her was a blackboard with a lot of writing on it. He’d been counting the days to the end of summer. It was like she was reading his mind. He wondered if that were possible.

“Hello, cowboy,” Cindy said.

“Hi, Cindy,” he said. “You going back to school?”

“We are going back to school,” she replied. “You have about four weeks left of summer, and then you’re going to be sitting in rooms just like this for several hours a day.”

“Fucking kind of you to bring that up,” he said.

“That’s exactly the attitude we don’t want to see,” Cindy said. “Besides...” Her robes morphed into a tight white cotton button-down shirt, maybe two sizes too small, or maybe she was a couple sizes too big, and an equally tight black skirt, showing long legs in sheer stockings. A pair of black-rimmed glasses solidified on her nose and she blinked once dramatically. “...You and I are going to make this time a fun time.”

“Woah!” He sat up.

“And if you don’t behave...” she growled. Her right hand now held a black wand, like an orchestra conductor. She raised this and snapped it forward. There was a loud ‘click’ as though it had actually struck the inside surface of the LCD screen. Nick jerked back instinctively. “...Cindy will be very angry with you.”

“Can I count on that?”

“Have your fun, cowboy, while you can. But you will do your homework. Besides, you make Cindy happy and...”

“And?”

“See this button?” She used the wand to point to the top button of her shirt.

“Umhmmm.”

“When Cindy is happy, this button might just... pop.” She raised one eyebrow.

“Newton’s best law.” He tried to sound cool but he was breathing rapidly.

“Let’s get started.” She sat back on the edge of the desk. “Do you remember your homework for the summer?”

“Nobody does the summer homework.”

“Let’s try this again. Do you remember your summer homework? Or would you rather I take your avatar and stick this pointer where no pointer has gone before?” She walked around the desk to the blackboard. The screen followed her movements.

“Read this for me.” She pointed to the top line on the board.

“The Great Gatsby, by F. Scott Fitzgerald,” he said.

“Since I know what you’ve been doing this summer, I’m pretty sure you haven’t read anything longer than The Boondocks.”

“To be honest, I don’t, you know...” Nick hesitated.

“...read. That’s obvious, except you do read. You read dozens of chats and emails every day. So reading a book is not out of the question.”

“Why not just watch the movie or Query it?”

“That’s about like you asking yourself ‘why don’t I rub my nose to beat off’. It’s because watching a movie not the same thing as reading the book. OK?”

“Now, who’s got the attitude.” He slouched back in his chair.

“Sorry, Nicky.” Cindy went back to the desk and sat behind it. “I know that reading seems one-dimensional after doing the Queries. So I’m going to teach you how to read really fast, so you can read The Great Gatsby in, say, twenty minutes.”

“That works.” He sat up.

Nick watched as Cindy went through another set of exercises, this one strictly with the eyes. These, she told him, are advanced techniques that rely on the fact that you’ve already opened up the door to your memory.

“Maybe Wanda should be teaching me these.” He teased.

“Wanda’s busy. So am I. Pay attention now, Cindy knows what you need.”

And she did.
