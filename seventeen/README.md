# Seventeen
Desi’s apartment in Sao Do was no larger than any of the others. No hierarchy here. He stepped out on his balcony, which looked out over the compound and beyond to the river. Soft, still air hit his face like a damp velvet rag. The lounger was covered with moisture, as though night and morning had just finished making love, and the morning lay there in her sweat while the night wandered off for a cigarette. He took a towel to the lounger and then he reclined in the matinal gloom awaiting the sunrise, sipping his milk-sweetened, metal-press, highland coffee.

The compound awakened below him, food stall workers wiped the dew off the chairs, expecting their early customers at first light. Dozens of pots of pho broth simmered in the darkness. The pungent odors reminded Desi of Mysore with its daily masala of scents; the smoke from the burning nityapuja dhup incense, cow dung fires in the village, stale urine on the walls, something dead and decaying in the field nearby. The funk of life and of death, unsanitized by middle-class aesthetics. One of the stall owners noticed him and bowed deeply. Desi waved back and the fellow’s face opened up to a smile as easy as a sunrise. The early ferryboats chugged down the river toward Hoi An.

In the Sao Do compound, everyone, from grade-school munchkin to grandfather, ate all their meals in the food stalls, following the “restaurant every meal” template. Why make five hundred families cook their own food in five hundred kitchens, when fifty professional cooks in a dozen kitchens can do so with far greater economy and skill? This meant that mothers and fathers could awaken, bathe, enjoy a coffee and get their children up without dashing around a kitchen attempting breakfast.

Desi watched families emerge from their apartments, greet each other, their children jockeying for chairs at their favorite tables. They sat down to a breakfast professionally cooked, many of them doing the Brainwave exercises as they chatted.

The school kids began to migrate over their classrooms on the eastern side of the compound, the programmers headed to their offices on the western side. Grandparents and spouses lingered at the cafes and then drifted away, either to the clubhouses where there were dominos and other games, exercise classes, the organic gardens, various adult education offerings, or to the ferry landing for the commute to Hoi An for work or shopping.

Most of the morning crowd wore their black hats and a many of them carried the blue shoulder bags. Several of the younger school kids, still too young to play the Game, wore the grey “Y.U. Athletic Department” t-shirts their parents could buy. Most of the Game’s programming had been done right in this compound, so its influence seemed only natural. He had no idea that a similar scene was emerging in villages across the planet.

Desi told Jack that this capitalist enterprise had fulfilled the vision of communist Vietnam, and Jack reminded him they weren’t making any money. In five years, when the contracts were up, the whole place would need to be self-sustaining. The sun continued on its path, chasing the last student into class at the bell. Desi’s balcony would soon be too hot. He did his own Brainwave exercises while he contemplated the day’s agenda.

They had finally solved the problem of hosting the Game  client on Computos, millions of which had been distributed through UNESCO over the past three years. Hand-cranked and satellite WiFi enabled, Computos dissolved the digital divide in remote villages worldwide. Desi had extended the DocDo language capabilities of the Game into dozens of tribal languages, from Navajo to Oshiwambo. Technical vocabulary remained problematic; Desi built complex ontologies that automatically rephrased them. He felt this to be a clumsy but adequate solution. The remaining problem was throughput. The bandwidth for many of these villages was so low that entirely new compression algorithms were needed. It was like pouring Niagara Falls into a bathtub. Desi was in charge of the data-compression team, and they were still not happy with the quality of the video in the Queries.

The horizon went on forever; enormous clouds scudded across the prairie. A clutch of eagle feathers on the nearby pole waved at her in the breeze. A cloud of flies surrounded her, distracting her view. Megan scanned the scene, but Bobby was nowhere in sight. She was crouching on the dirt next to a small fire over which a brace of buffalo sinew slices absorbed its acrid smoke. A gaunt dog peeked around the wikiup, eyeing the meat. Her avatar picked up a stone and shied it at the dog, which ducked out of sight. A small child, naked, caked with dust, toddled out of the wikiup and squatted to pee. Megan toggled to third-person-hover. Her avatar was dressed in a deerskin worn like a serape. It was chewing some kind of leather strip. It was horribly fat. No, it was pregnant to bursting.

“Bobby, I said ‘wind on my face,’ not stretch marks. Give me something different. How about super romantic?”

The monitor went black and then opened up with a new scene. She was riding Marmalade through a wind-carved sandstone landscape. Rock monoliths towered on either side, emblazoned by the setting sun. Bobby rode a bit ahead. Their horses walked easily, hoof beats percussive on the rock floor. A nearby waterfall, teal against the damp red stone of its course, added a sibilant harmony to the hoofbeats.

“This is more like it!” She sent Marmalade into a brief canter to catch up with Bobby. They rode together between two gigantic stone mittens.

After a time, Megan toggled to third-person-hover and looked at her avatar riding bareback. Its raven hair was braided into luxurious pigtails, interlaced with beads and leather, all the way down her back. It was dressed in a short, snug doe-skin dress, slit up the side. It had breasts the size of grapefruits.

“Hey! Am I supposed to be Pocahontas or Jessica Rabbit? And look at you? Whose fantasy is this, anyhow?”

“This scene is an amalgam of popular cultural images. There are referents from Disney, MGM, Warner Brothers, Russ Meyer...”

“Give me back my own avatar. And stop looking so... so, Italian. What happened to the nice Sir Robert I met on the beach?”

Her avatar morphed into her standard Junana image. Bobby was again wearing his doublet.

Bobby turned Shadow around to face her. “I gain in nuance and complexity as you grow in the Game.”

She looked at him. Bobby had taken her to so many different places in the past year, she always imagined him to be the one thing that never changed. Now she knew he was simply keeping up with her. They were changing together.

Winston started a series of articles for one of Wharton’s online journals. Under the heading of “Embracing Uncertainty in a Smart Economy,” he outlined strategies for corporations looking to build market share as the market shrank.

His essays were filled with statistics from a spectrum of published sources, although the facts he gleaned from within Junana were much more relevant. He pointed to the fiasco of the college testing service as a bellwether for the new smart economy. In the last three months fully 35 percent of the test takers had scored at or near the top score possible, paralyzing the whole college admission system.

“Like that of the smarter student,” he wrote, “the impact of the smart consumer will change the entire landscape of the marketplace. The smart worker will also revolutionize the workplace.”

 Winston’s career had been in derivatives and other contrarian theories, so his new writings fit this topic tighter than OJ’s glove. He scrubbed his prose to remove any trace of the template sayings, which had become so much a part of the conversations he had with his Guide, having reached Level Three in the Game.

After the fifth weekly installment in this series, The Economist called him for an interview. They arranged a videoconference between London and Philadelphia. In only a few minutes it was clear that the journalist who interviewed Winston was an avid Game player. Winston had to deflect several questions that would have revealed his own Game status.

“We have the computing capability to approach each individual without requiring that they identify with a larger cohort. If only corporate boards and officers showed the same individuality as their customers, we could rebuild the marketplace on the solid ground of serving every customer’s actual needs,” Winston concluded.

The Economist article led to another piece in the New Yorker, and then a book deal with Farrar, Strauss and Giroux. Winston judiciously declined offers from the speaking circuit, but he did give lectures at Wharton and Berkeley and was scheduled to do commencement at Reed in the spring. The commencement-speaker selection committee included a person with whom he had been intimately familiar, back when he was a senior and she a freshman.

It was her first RennFayre and his last. Winston had decided on a clown golf outfit. Scratchy said he looked like Moe in “Three Little Beers.” Winston had decided to narrow down his first-day recreational drug use to mushrooms and champagne. He had a supply of the former, and figured he could swap some for the bubbly. Desi was dressed in a sari with a huge turban. Itchy had on his favorite cowboy outfit. Scratchy went commando in Oshkosh overalls.

The day before, they had turned in their theses and ransacked the library playfully. That morning they hit the campus in high spirits, Desi floated across the green in nine-yards of Benares silk. Winston carried an ancient wood-shafted niblick for looks. He spied this young thing coming out of the old dorm block with a bottle of Veuve Clicquot, its bright yellow label visible from a hundred yards. And yes, she was willing to trade some; only she’d never done mushrooms before and expected him to stick around in case she flipped out.

Her name was Claire Cassaday. They ended spending all day and night together and the next day and night too. The entire time was smudged in his memory in bright colors and laughter. He remembered running across the fairways of Eastmoreland, but not the naked part. That part she reminded him about in an email after his interview for the commencement speaker.

She didn’t need to remind him of the sex, which was frequent and frenzied over those forty-eight hours, as though they were required to consummate an entire adult relationship in one weekend. Of course, he was moving back to Philadelphia on Monday. She knew that from the minute they met. They were both crying at the airport, it had been so sudden and then so suddenly over. They wrote for a while, until she got a new boyfriend. Then, 25 years later, she was on the commencement committee conference call as Claire Doolan. As they spoke, his heart did a little back flip into a pool of DayGlo nostalgia.

Reverend Bishop stood in his pulpit and waited until the final notes of “The Old Rugged Cross” stopped echoing in the vast hall. Leroy Stubbs’s baritone was sublime and uplifting. The Reverend held aloft his white leather Bible and sent his eyes across the congregation.

“We will read today from the book of King James I.” He took the bible in both hands. “But not this book, not the holiest of holies.” He set the bible down on the pulpit and picked up a piece of paper. Without looking at it he continued.

“King James awoke one sunday morning to the timbre of church bells tolling across the great town of London. After dressing he went to a window in Buckingham Palace. The King was fully expecting to see the good people of London, parents, grandparents, and their children. Toddlers carried on the shoulders of their dads, the infirm helped along in carts; everyone making their way to the church of their choice. For it was the sabbath, and the entire kingdom would worship God for blessing them with this noble King. But James, who, years before, had written the first royal decrees against the sodomites...”

The congregation murmured approvingly at this piece of news. Bishop’s researcher on this topic had included the fact that James had three known male lovers.

The Reverend held their complete attention. “...was the same King James who did authorize and promote the reading of the word of God through the translation of this by the best religious scholars of his age. Even today this translation is the most valued, the most impressive, the most revered ever published. The one true revelation of God and his only son.” He held aloft his Bible to a chorus of “amens.”

“Good King James looked out of his window on that Sunday, and what do you think he saw?” Bishop turned to look at the number two camera down at the foot of the pulpit, just as if he were James I looking down on the crowds.

“The mob, released from work by the grace of their king. The throng, heedless of the music of the church bells. Instead they played all manner of devices and games: baiting bulls and bears, gambling on dice, conjuring up comedies and making fun of those who were trying to walk that narrow path through the chaos of the streets in order to attend their Sunday service.”

Overhead the projectors spilled images from Breugel the Elder, medieval crowds engaged in multiple perversions. The congregation gasped like one enormous terrified animal.

“And what did King James do?”

The projected scenes switched to paintings of halcyon landscapes with whitewashed churches. Bishop waved the piece of paper he had been holding.

“He wrote this law and made the sabbath safe again for his God-fearing servants. He ordered these hideous games banished and told the nation as one people to attend service on Sunday.”

“I can report that the King was not indiscriminate in his condemnation of recreation on the sabbath. No, he was very clear about this.” Bishop let a smile grow on his face. “Like many of you, I, myself, can admit to this one small sin. King James had a weakness for...” Bishop leaned closer over the pulpit as if divulging a secret. “...football.”

The congregation broke into laughter. The choir rocked and kidded each other. Bishop threw his head back and joined in.

“Let me tell you, God himself must have been proud that day to have King James as his quarterback.” He set down the paper and reached his right hand into the pulpit.

Bishop waved his left arm across the pulpit. “Are you comfortable?” His voice rang across the room.

The congregation muttered and shifted nervously. The way he asked made them all distinctly uncomfortable.

“Because if you are, it is because King James and many others put their lives on the line to make the sabbath a special day, a day of rest and worship, and yes a day of comfort to the weary. So please do take comfort all of you here today and watching from your homes. Take comfort in the fact that, unlike King James, you can listen to church bells and watch the congregations gather in peace and quiet. But wait!”

Bishop thrust his left hand up in the air. “What is this I hear? Not the sibilance of the church bells. Not the whisper of freshly shined shoes on the steps of the chapel. Not the greetings of friends and neighbors in the narthex. I hear the electronic rumble of games, games of chance and violence, pagan games with false gods and demons, salacious games that offer sex to children. To children!” he roared, “...and on the holy sabbath!”

The video screens erupted with a montage of violent action scenes from video games. First person shooters splattered opponents with grenades and sniper rifles, hideous demons tore players apart in fountains of blood. Players attacked drug addicts with baseball bats and TASERed scantily clad prostitutes. Automobiles accelerated into crowded bus stops and veered to run down pregnant women, children, and elderly couples using walkers. Crowds of teenagers armed with pitchforks and chainsaws battled battalions of zombie babies. The scenes made Breugel look like Norman Rockwell. The congregation recoiled with shouts and screams.

Bishop walked over to the center of the stage as the video montage dissolved into slow motion scenes of video cafes showing dozens of teenagers enraptured by their gameplay, their eyes glued to the action.

“And those scenes,” he waved at the screen, “are the tame ones, the shots we can show on television.” He bowed his head as if in prayer and stood silent while the crowd settled.

“What am I holding here?” Bishop’s right hand lifted up a three-foot section of an electrical extension cord, its plug end dangling.

“Why look, you say, this is something everybody has in their house. It’s an electrical extension cord. I tell you now my friends, plug this into a computer on Sunday and it becomes the tail of the devil.”

He switched into his soft voice. A kindly father explaining to his young son that his beloved puppy is dead. “The devil has stolen your children from the Lord’s day. He has crept into your daughter’s bedroom and set up camp. He has snatched your son’s attention and now holds him in his thrall. How many of you are here today while your children are at home?” He let that thought hover for a minute.

He looked straight at camera one. “How many of you at home are watching while your children are in their rooms? On their computers. Doing their homework?” Bishop wagged his finger. “I don’t think so.”

“I am calling on all of you watching at home to stand up. Right this minute. That’s it, stand up. And we will stand up with you.”

On cue the choir stood. The group leaders in the audience stood and the rest of the congregation hurried to their feet.

“Stand up for Jesus! You at home. Now go into your child’s room. Take the devil by the tail and pull the plug on Satan!” He tossed the electrical cord down the steps as though it was a viper set to strike. “Go on now. We will have a musical interlude while you are away. Brother Stubb, give us a song.”

The Sunday shift at WeRus in Goleta was normally a down time, and the sysadmin on duty ran a few diagnostics. He watched football, played the Game, or dozed in the Cordobalounger in Scratchy’s office. They took the Sunday shifts in turn.

It was about 11:40 in the morning when the XServe array lit up like Times Square. Thousands of disk drives spun up simultaneously. Vast amounts of computer memory were being addressed. Information cascaded from the backbone Ariadne fiber connection.

Barry was watching the Packers and the Vikings in the lounge. He had a couple players from the Vikings on fantasy team. He heard the electrical grid alarm go off as a sudden demand for power tripped the battery backup system. Thinking it was another glitch in the local electrical grid—Edison tended to run its own diagnostics on Sundays—Barry wandered over to the window wall and glanced at the front panel of the enormous battery system, which was blinking red, as expected. Then he noticed the entire XServe was lit up like Christmas at Macy’s.

Barry ran to the control monitor. The logs were scrolling faster than he could read them. Nothing was failing yet; however, the load was enormous. The throughput on Ariadne was enough to fill the entire optical fiber pipe down to Los Angeles. Good thing it was a Sunday. He hesitated only momentarily and then looked up the text message codes in the company’s emergency manual. He sent the code for a general alert to the phones of all company executives.

In the supercomputer’s room the air-conditioning units kicked on high. Two thousand quad CPUs were radiating as they processed billions of trillions of instructions. A new klaxon of electrical alarms were joined by the sudden roar of the diesel engine outside. The emergency generators had started up automatically to help with the internal power load.

Barry watched the admin console. He filtered the log display so he could monitor only the major system alerts. The supercomputers in India and Japan now shared the load. Countless petaflops of calculations fed a stream of instructions between the three computers and the entire Junana network. Incredibly, nothing was failing under the load. Not yet. The phone rang. It was Don. Barry told him things were under control for the time being. Don wanted Berry to be sure the log cache was backed up so they could run some diagnostics on Monday.

Less than ten minutes later, the supercomputer began to quiet. Barry watched the throughput diminish to its usual trickle. Within half an hour the entire system was back to normal. The quiet was almost as alarming as the noise had been. The event log was several gigs. Barry burned it onto an xDVD, labeled this and left it on Don’s desk. He watched the monitor for another few minutes and then returned to the lounge, where the Packers had scored three times in the second quarter.

“Damn.”

Sunday morning at his dad’s house in Lompoc, Nick was in his bedroom using the Santa Barbara High School KayAye to explore exothermic and endothermic reactions of molecules. Cindy gave him a problem where the enthalpy of formation of the products was greater than the enthalpy of formation of the reactants. The Query space had half a dozen tools to explore the molecular geometry, Nick chose Lewis structures.

He was just about to key in his answer when Babs, his dad’s new girl friend, burst into his room.

“Babs, I’m not fraking dressed.” He grabbed up a pair of long shorts to cover his boxers.

She glanced around and spied the electric outlet beside his desk.

“Out Satan!” she shouted. “Out of this house!” She strode across the room and yanked his laptop’s AC cord from the socket.

“Hey!” He turned in his chair. “This is my room!”

Babs held the cord triumphantly. Then she noticed that his laptop was still on.

“What the...?” He shifted his body between her and his computer. “Get outta here!”

She glanced around the room. “Aha!” She dove to the other wall and tugged his cable modem’s power brick from the socket, jerking it also from the modem. “Free your mind of filth and degradation!”

“Are you off your meds?” Nick asked, “Where’s my dad?”

“You won’t be needing this.” She held the power supply like a dead rat in her hand, its thin cord dangling. Then she stormed back into the family room and slammed the door behind her.

Nick threw on shorts and a shirt. He contemplated wrestling the power supply away from Babs, but decided instead to ride over to the Red Star. He gathered his laptop into the shoulder bag, grabbed his deck, and laced up his sneakers.

Nick ducked into the kitchen for a toaster pastry. Over in the family room Babs held the power brick in her hand while she watched some TV preacher wave a white bible around. His dad was probably still asleep. He opened up the fridge, grabbed a half-gallon on milk, leaned back against the counter and took a long slug.

His mom had a new boyfriend who didn’t like to see him around the house. Didn’t really want to see him at all. The feeling was mutual. Now it was clear he couldn’t move in here. Babs was way too high-maintenance.

Nick had just turned sixteen and was seriously into Level Four. The new KayAye interface made school a dream. He spent his whole day thick into the Game.

Ms. Baxter was already on Level Three. She asked him a question about Simplicity Loves Difference and he told her how he had to unfold that template structure down to its seed on Level Four. Cindy said he should get into the lottery for the Isla Vista GameTown. She said she could try to get him a job in the gym or one of the restaurants. There must be thousands of Gamers trying to get in and only a hundred spaces or so.

If only Jackie Kim were still around, maybe he could hang out at her house. She went emo when she hit Level Five in September. Took a bunch of her mother’s pills and ended up on Five-East at Cottage Hospital. When she got out, her family moved her out of town and off Junana. Might as well have taken her to another planet. In the other room, Babs clicked off the TV. Nick ducked out the kitchen door.

Don Driscoll checked the admin logs again. Scratchy had been curious about the content surge on Sunday. It almost brought them down, he said. Then he added, “that won’t happen after we do the final port.” He didn’t answer Don when he asked what “port” Scratchy was referring too.

Several times in the past month, the five anonymous users had independently entered transporters to goth scenes and then logged out. That was strange enough, but what caught his attention is that every one of them logged out exactly five minutes after entering the goth scene. Not four minutes and fifty-nine seconds, not five minutes and one second. So they were being logged out by a preset program. But were they actually logged out, or did the program take them somewhere else? He would need to follow one of them, but how?

Don opened up the file again, the one that showed the least expected aspects of the admin corpus. One page three he discovered that fifty-thousand plus users had chosen to turn off their collision detection. This triggered something in his memory, and Don opened up the admin file for avatar preferences. The fields of the data model for avatar appearance preferences ran for two pages.

Don logged into Junana.com and checked the user interface for the same preferences. The switch for turning off the collision detection was at the bottom of a submenu and on page two of the data model. The effect of doing this was that the avatar could walk through other objects, and other avatars could also walk right through the avatar. Looking from the actual data model to the user interface, Don noticed something else.

“Bingo!” he whispered.

One of the preferences available in the data model and the admin GUI but not implemented in the user interface was “transparency.” The settings were in percentage points. If you set this to zero, your avatar would be invisible. Probably a feature on the original design, or something the programmer put in that the customer decided not to use. Since there was no user interface for this setting, nobody on Junana could change their transparency from the default setting of one-hundred percent. Nobody, that is, but Don, who simply found his own avatar’s table in the database and, through his ROOT admin access manually reset this value to “zero.”

His avatar was standing in its default plaza. Don toggled Third Person and, instead of seeing his avatar from overhead, there was just the floor. He waved his avatar’s hands, and still no image. Another avatar, headed for one of the transporters, walked briskly into the middle of his field of vision and bounced back.

“What the fuck?” it said, and walked ahead, only to rebound one more time. It turned to the left and strode out of the scene.

Don went to the user interface menus and called up the preferences for his avatar. He chose a submenu and unchecked the box for collision detection. He was now both invisible and immaterial. He went back to the main menu and found the submenu for speech. He turned off the sound, so he wouldn’t chuckle and reveal himself, and then set the current settings as a default so the changes would be saved.

He wandered through the plaza, poking his avatar into the middle of conversations. As long as they did not set these to “private” and encrypt them, his proximity gave him access to their audio. And since he could drift unseen right into the middle of a throng, nobody was the wiser. He felt like the invisible man. Now all he needed to do was set up an email alarm for when any of the five logged in.

§ § §

Scratchy popped into the Room and found Itchy standing near one of the walls. Itchy was working at a console, a large translucent screen hovered in front of him. Scratchy noted that he now wore the yellow shirt.

“Finished that next level, I see,” he said, slumping into one of the Cordobaloungers.

“Hi Michael,” Itchy did not turn around. “I’ll be just a minute here. I’m setting up a statistical run on last month’s consumer numbers, and the European Union changed its data model on me. I can call up another console if you want to play the Game.”

“Not unless you can bring up Halo 5. I’m stuck in the tower on level three.”

“Aren’t you even going to try the Game?”

“I’ve been through school. And I’ve got my own shoes, thank you very much.”

Desi’s avatar appeared, dressed in the crimson cape and carrying his staff.

“Grand Meister in the house!” Scratchy yelped. “Everybody grab your kids.”

“Hello, Mikey.” Desi’s avatar strode forward and threw its arms around Scratchy’s shoulders over the back of the chair. “You command shift H for a hug.”

“Command shift H yourself,” Scratchy said.

“Why so grumpy?”

“Got a little letter from the IRS. Seems they plan to stick their boots clean up my ass. And my house is still besieged by investors and groupies, so I’m camping out at one of Tad’s hotels.”

“Itchy, have you seen the code for JS?” Desi asked. “I hope I didn’t delete it.”

“JS?” Scratchy said. “You mean that talking robot thing you sent me?”

“Our prototype Guide,” Itchy said. “I don’t think the code made it into the Game build. It should be on the old IDE.”

“But it’s not, I checked. I wanted to do a comparison between the old JS code and the current state of the Guide code. They’re acquiring so many new behaviors.”

Jack’s avatar appeared, also in a yellow shirt.

“Isn’t anybody working anymore?” Scratchy asked. “Or do we just play the Game from here on out?”

“Not everybody gets it naturally,” Jack said. “Not anybody, apart from you, Michael.”

“Mr. Natural!” Desi laughed. “Oh, snap!”

This set them all laughing, and Scratchy toggled a grin that spread across his avatar’s convict face like a hillside earthquake fault line.

“I miss a joke?” Winston appeared, dressed in a plaid sweater, tweed plus-fours, a tam cap, a wide bow tie, and the brown shoes.

“Winston, you’ve earned your shoes!” Desi skipped forward and gave him a hug.

“I am worried about earning the hat. It doesn’t go with any of my golf attire.”

“Like a hooked drive into the rough,” Itchy said.

“Or a shanked wedge shot,” Desi said.

“Or a case of the yips,” Scratchy said.

They turned to Jack.

“Um, or a buried sand lie,” he said.

“Well, the gang’s all here,” Scratchy said. “What’s the big crisis?”

Nick logged in. Cindy was standing there, back on the beach in her jeans and that top he remembered she wore commando the first day. She was still just as perky.

“Hello, cowboy.” She tousled her hair like she does, and his heart did a little flip.

“Cindy. My room is excellent. I’m so happy!” He’d moved into the Isla Vista Gametown with a job as busboy in the Vietnamese vegetarian restaurant there. His roommate was also a Fourvey and a surfer.

“Keep your pants on. I don’t need to see no buttons coming loose.” Cindy coughed and a chill ran up Nick’s spine. He had been waiting for this. Known about it for some time. Still not ready, not nearly so.

“Don’t do that!” He cried out. “I need you!”

“You did, you know. You really did. That’s why this isn’t easy.”

“Then take me back. I’ll do Level Two. Hell, I’ll do Level One again. Just don’t go.”

“Nicky. I was here for you, and now it’s your turn for me. We came through everything together. I am the best Guide in the Game. You agree?”

“Fuckin’ A right,” he answered, tearing.

“I wouldn’t be the best if I didn’t know when it was time for you to move ahead.”

He thought about that. Thought as hard as he could. He had no answer, just a knot like a knife in his gut.

“You be a good Fiver and don’t waste all your time on Free-for-Alls. You promise me!” She jabbed her finger at him. “Tell me you are stoked to start Level Five.”

His breath was coming heavy as he fought off tears.

“Tell me!”

“Yeah, I’m stoked. I really am.” He sniffled.

“I’m not supposed to do this,” she looked around guiltily. “But you’ve been such a good boy of late.”

She undid her belt buckle and stepped out of her jeans. She was wearing little pink panties with white fringe. Then she shucked her top over her head and dropped it on the sand. She stood and showed him what he’d fantasized for two years. It was fully worth the wait.

“You’re so beautiful,” he whispered.

“Only all of me,” she said. “So long, cowboy!”

She turned and walked slowly, ever so slowly, into the surf where she walked out on the waters and then turned to face him. Cindy tilted her head slightly to the left and draped her right hand over her luscious breasts. She slowly sank into the surf.

“Botticelli,” he whispered. “Excellent exit, Cindy!”

He watched her head dip into the waters and then watched the waves for about half an hour before he shut down the computer and grabbed his board.
