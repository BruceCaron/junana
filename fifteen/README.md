# Fifteen
Claire walked into the room, into the glass and steel board room of the RIND corporation, where her quarterly report would be interrogated by a panel of experts from industry and government. She wore her black Armani silk dress and took her place at the far end of the table from the Chair. The room was abuzz with heated conversation as the panel members passed along papers and charts and gestured in anger, an emotion, she noticed, undergirded with fear.

Each of the panel participants reported to a sector of the economy, to the music industry, or to fashion, film, housing, automotive, restaurants: anywhere people would spend their money. The undersecretary of commerce was here, too, although this was not the meeting he normally attended. He had just announced an uptick in the consumer confidence findings, so why was he over in the corner, playing with his BlackBerry, with an enormous frown across his brow?

Nobody looked at Claire, but it was her report they were furiously waving about. They wanted it, and her, to simply disappear, and so did she. Perhaps she could tiptoe away. The Chair was the recently retired head of the Hollywood Film Commission, whose job had been to staunch the flow of intellectual property into the hands of “pirates,” meaning college students with a Mac and the software key provided by the kid from Sweden. Tag Laurent had the demeanor of a retired game show host, He stood and lifted his hands like Moses gesturing to the Red Sea. The room fell silent.

“I want to thank you all for being here today,” he said, “It seems we have a lot to talk about. Ms. Doolan,” he nodded at her. “I hope you can shed some light on this report of yours. As I read it, we have entered a, well, a province of some difficulty.”

“Up shit creek to its headwaters,” Jill Strong spoke up. Jill represented the fashion industry association.

“Thank you, Jill.” He nodded politely, although his eyes steeled. “Claire, you have the floor.” Then he reached into his jacket.

Claire sat frozen for a second, her eyes on his hand. He pulled a handkerchief from his coat as he sat, and touched his mouth. She stood, and the room darkened for the projector. The first powerpoint slide was illuminated, and the room let out a collective groan.

“These are the predictions for the next quarter. I see you need no help interpreting this one,” she started, “but, believe me, it only gets worse. Those of you who thought the Wall Street Bailout a couple years ago was rough...well, hold on to something.” She flipped to the next slide.

In the four years since the road was built not one fire truck had turned around in Lotta Vista Lane. On that late Saturday morning when Scratchy woke up, the road was so packed with cars and news vans that you’d have trouble turning a bicycle in it. He had installed a fence tall enough to keep the coyotes away from his cats and a gate with an electronic opener but no doorbell. Arriving friends could call him on his cell phone, everyone else could wait. That’s what a huge crowd was now doing; it looked like a couple hundred people.

“I’m gonna need a taller fence,” Scratchy grumbled to himself, glancing through the blinds of his bedroom into the winter sun. Dozens of cars and vans were still arriving. They clogged Hillside Drive in both directions. He was trapped.

The day the global programming community woke up to find the entire technology template schema posted on Source Forge was given a name by Slash|Dash: Prometheus II. The second gift of fire. By noon, California time, it seemed that every geek in the Western Hemisphere had joined the rest of the world in downloading the 36 templates. For that one day Scratchy eclipsed the entire movie, fashion, music, social, and political fame machines. He was Charles Lindberg, Princess Di, Michael Jordan, Bill Gates, Tiger Woods famous. Everybody wanted to hear from Michael “Scratchy” O’hara.

The presidents of nations, Fortune 500 CEOs, major studio chiefs, talent agency heads, international NGO executive directors, and government laboratory lead scientists instructed their assistants to put Michael O’hara on their calendars ASAP. Squadrons of business jets were converging on Santa Barbara airport for this purpose.

When Michael turned his cell phone on, it was ringing and the message box was full. He turned it off again and went to his computer. His trusty MacBook Pro had been on all night, and there were just over 30,000 unread messages starting from 17 minutes after he had posted the code to about an hour later, when his mail server failed.

For the first half hour or so, the email was from names he knew; they were mainly European programmers from his dot-com days. After that, it looked like somebody sold his email address, or posted it somewhere that was spidered. Then the email server just went berserk and ate itself. Without a phone or email he had no way to get word to friends in Santa Barbara who might help bust him out of his own house.

After a brief shower, he was getting dressed when he heard the noise. A helicopter was approaching and fast. Scratchy grabbed up the pair of binoculars he kept near the window and scoped the sheriff’s helicopter ranging up hill toward his property. He slipped into his Berks and stepped outside. In his favorite Fritz the Cat hemp t-shirt and drawstring hemp pants he looked like Lebowski’s slacker uncle.

Down at the fence a hundred cameras converged on him amid a cacophony of shouted questions. He started to flip them off, reconsidered mid-gesture and threw them a Spock salute to cover the move. Much to his chagrin, the image of this made the cover of a thousand newspapers. Even geeks have their pride.

When the loudspeaker voice from the descending ’copter asked permission to land on his driveway, he nodded vigorously and shouted “Fuck, yes!” into its downdraft. The rescue ’copter slid down on the asphalt in front of his garage. Scratchy duck-walked over to the open pilot’s door.

“Mr. O’hara,” the pilot shouted, removing his headset. “The crowd at your gate is a public nuisance.”

“Damn straight,” Scratchy nodded. “I’d recommend you strafe them. Maybe use RPGs on the bigger vans.”

The pilot grinned. “I have another idea. We remove you, and they’ll take care of themselves.”

“Remove me?” Scratchy did not like the sound of that.

“Don’t misunderstand, sir. You are not under arrest. Tad Goldwyn has offered the San Jacinto Ranch for your use over the next several days. I’ll leave two officers here to keep out the curious.”

“That’s right neighborly of old Tad.” Scratchy had never met Tad Goldwyn. Tad had made a sizable fortune selling children’s clothing. A whole generation grew up in “Tads.” Now he had moved most of his fortune into real estate. Scratchy wondered if Mr. Slick had sent word to ol’ Tad.

“Lemme get a few things. Just be a minute.”

Scratchy went back inside, grabbed his laptop and firewire drives. He threw a few changes of underwear and a toothbrush into a delivery bag. He looked around for Sasha and Skrotum, but the helicopter had probably driven his house cats into their deep hidey holes. He triple-locked his study but left the house unlocked for the cops. When he returned to the helicopter, two uniformed officers had dismounted and were chatting with the pilot. The back seat was empty, and Scratchy set his bags on the floor.

“You’ll need to feed my cats,” he yelled at the officers as the pilot revved up the rotor. “They each get half a can a day and some kibble and water. It’s all in the kitchen.” One of the officers nodded and smiled. Scratchy went up to the other one. “Anything happens to my pussycats, and I’ll see that coyotes feast on your nuts.” He made eye contact and kept this until the other fellow nodded and looked away.

“Goddamn dog people,” he muttered to himself as he climbed into the helicopter.

The helicopter rose in a cloud of clay dust. The television cameras from 40 trucks followed it as it climbed. Already, cars were trickling away as the word came down that the action was moving from Lotta Vista Lane to the Ranch hotel on the other side of town.

“What the hell did you do, anyhow?” The pilot asked him when they leveled off. “Win the lottery?”

“Nope.” Scratchy enjoyed the view. The city looked quiet and lovely on the balmy Saturday afternoon. Out to sea, a string of bizjets were circling to land at the municipal airport. He wondered if some movie star was getting married in Montecito.

“Someone die and make you king?” The pilot asked.

“Nah. I put myself out of work.” Scratchy realized as he spoke that it was true. With the 36 technology templates, a lot of the world’s computer programming needs were going to be realized in short order.

The pilot looked at him. Scratchy had let his hair grow again over the last few years. His hat was a droopy leather fedora.

“Fuckin’ hippy,” The pilot mumbled.

Scratchy just smiled.

“Someone is actively disenchanting ‘The Now’,” said Harold Farmer, the chairman of the RIND Corporation and author of the seminal work, The Now is a Foreign Land. The group around the RIND conference table stole looks at one another.

Harold stood. He strode to the window and looked down, as if searching for the thief out on the street. Behind him, the table fell silent as each participant attempted to assemble the meaning of this pronouncement for their own arena. Everyone had, of course, read the book, which made a huge splash 20 years before. At that time, there was some fear that Farmer’s own research would also work to disenchant The Now, simultaneously announcing and dissolving the target of his study.

The Now is a Foreign Land looked at consumer behavior as the result of a compulsive attraction for The Now, a manufactured self-seduction process that had emerged from decades of product turnover and mass advertising. The desire for The Now, he announced, was an addictive behavior that could be triggered in the body by the age of eight, and would then, through constant feeding, control the emotional tone of the consumer at least through their thirties, when its effects tended to wear off. Encouraging this addiction had built entire industries in film, fashion, music, sports, home furnishings, and publishing.

Farmer’s book detailed how the penetration of advertising and mass marketing into the ex-Soviet states had split their populations into the older cohort of post-17 year olds who never acquired the addiction, and the younger population, which developed hyperaddictive behavior, turning cities in Poland, the Czech Republic, and elsewhere into youthful capitalist playgrounds. After 10 years, 90 percent of the consumption in post-communist Europe was by the population under the age of 30. Older cohorts bought what they needed, younger cohorts bought The Now. The same was certainly true of China, as evidenced by Shanghai.

The enchantment of The Now, Farmer concluded, was by far capitalism’s greatest success. It wasn’t nuclear deterrence or Ronald Reagan that brought down the Berlin Wall; it was The Now, shining like a foreign sun right through the concrete, bleeding desire across no-man’s land to a hungry cohort of 17 year olds.

The Now was not to be confused with the present, in fact, The Now replaced the need for the present, for actual interaction with other people, inserting serial acts of consumption that satisfied this need in a manner that human relationships rarely could. Every morning the consumer would wake up knowing that yesterday’s Now was over and that their new car, new dress, new house, was no longer, well, Now. Every magazine they read, TV show they watched, billboard they passed on the way to work reminded them that The Now had moved on and it was time to catch up. The glory of The Now, he wrote, is that nobody ever does.

Harold came back to his seat and sat, his attention captive to some reflection. The room fell silent, as if mourning a dear friend.

“But how?” Tag Laurent demanded, scanning the faces around the table, his eyes fixed finally on Claire’s.

“We work with future trends, not with causal processes. We report the outcomes, not the sources,” she said. “I’ll have to defer to Harold on the topic of The Now.”

Dickey Gronberg, the undersecretary of commerce for consumer affairs, pulled up a brown shoe from his briefcase and laid this on the table.

“These are manufactured in a factory in Danang and shipped through a fulfillment service in Taipei. They are made entirely from recycled fibers, probably scraps from the garment industry. The dye is also natural. It’s called ‘catechu,’ distilled from acacia wood. The estimated manufacturing cost for a pair is about forty cents American. We estimate that about 10 million pairs have been shipped to the U.S., with likely 10 times that many across the globe.”

Jill picked up the shoe as if she were holding a live canal rat.

“It’s an ugly spud,” Dickey said, “but probably comfortable. What I want to know is, why shoes?”

Jill passed the shoe to the next person and looked at Dickey in disbelief.

“Why shoes? My god! Shoes are the foundation of the entire wardrobe. If you don’t have the right shoes, you simply cannot wear the dress, or the jeans, or the suit. And if you can’t wear the dress, why buy the dress? It’s brilliant! They are giving away ugly shoes, shoes that you can only wear with…” She gestured wildly, “....with Salvation Army flannel shirts and Wal-Mart jeans. And in the process they destroy a huge sector of a half-trillion dollar industry. We’re off a double-digit percent of sales in one quarter, and Mrs. Know-it-All here, to whom we’ve paid good money, can’t tell us when this might turn around.”

“But how do shoes affect movies and music?” Dickey asked. “Why are so many sectors tanking at the same time?”

“It’s really quite simple, Dickey. Millions of people have money in their wallets,” Harold said flatly, “because they aren’t shopping for the Now. They are wearing what they own until this is worn out. When they do shop, they shop for value. That’s why movies and music sales are all way down. Do you really think people actually want to buy the crap coming out of Hollywood and the big record labels? They have online access to thousands of movies, books, and songs, why wouldn’t they take, say, a decade or two, to watch, read, and listen to these?”

“Decades!” Tag spat the water he’d been drinking.

“When you take away the Now,” Harold concluded, “you open up the entire historical corpus of cultural production for reuse. The present has to compete with the past for the attention of consumers.”

“Godamn media pirates!” Tag croaked. “Reuse, you say? It’s thievery.”

Harold picked up the shoe and turned it in his hands. “The design of this reminds me of something.” He opened his computer, which switched the projector to it. They watched the screen as he called up a browser and searched an image of “sabot.” A page with a set of images was displayed. Several people started.

“This shoe is felt, not wood,” Harold noted. “But it appears that our nemesis has a sense of history.”

“Sabotage,” Tag whispered. “On a global scale.”

The rescue helicopter set down in the meadow, a grassy expanse where San Jacinto Ranch visitors had been holding weddings for more than seventy years. Princes and presidents, divas and debutantes, rockers and movie icons had been wed there in complete privacy; many others had used the Ranch for their honeymoons.

The Ranch occupied a foothill valley above Montecito, its hundred acres bounded by the national forest on the uphill side and San Jacinto creek on the Los Angeles side. Walls, fences, and, more recently, surveillance cameras were used to keep out the neighbors and the curious. As a guest ranch, it was open to all who could afford its upscale cowboy ambiance. With the rooms starting above 700 dollars and cottages $2000 a night, its visitors expected more than a hot shower.

The Ranch was renowned for its service. Cottage guests arrived to find their names embossed on the note paper in their suite. The Ranch’s Bentleys carried guests to and from the local night spots. A string of horses was available for trail rides, and guests could also bring their own ponies.

When Scratchy stepped down from the helicopter, he was met by a trim, sixty-something fellow in a smart blue suit, the Ranch’s manager, and by the jocular fifty-year-old Tad Goldwyn, dressed in chinos and a salmon polo shirt. A porter dressed like a Hollywood cowboy took his bag. Ducking instinctively, they quick-walked away from the still whirling rotors to a central building that housed the lobby and the hotel’s five-star restaurant. The helicopter rose and drifted back toward Santa Barbara.

“I’m Tad.” Goldwyn held out his hand, and Scratchy gave it a good shaking.

“Michael O’hara,” he said. “Right nice of you to help me out.”

“It looks like you’re in for a roller coaster ride for the next week or so. If I might ask, who normally manages your appointments?”

“That would be me,” Scratchy said. “If I remember right, I had a dentist appointment last spring.”

“I’ll loan you my personal secretary,” Tad suggested and turned to the manager. “Have Eric brought here and set up in the clubhouse office. Tell him he will be working for Mr. O’hara this week. He’ll need to hand off my appointments to Susan.”

After the manager strode off, Tad put his hand on Scratchy’s back. “Your cottage is over this way.”

The set off down the pebbled pathway between manicured rosemary shrubs. Scratchy noticed that several cottages had been recently vacated.

“I’m still wrapping my head around all this. Why is everyone so fucking excited?”

“When did you announce your findings?” Tad asked.

“About twelve hours ago. Then I went bed and, when I got up, well, it sure wasn’t Kansas anymore.”

“The Internet compresses time and space. You probably hadn’t finished brushing your teeth before someone was shouting about your discovery to the European press. The blogs caught the buzz and passed it along, and CNN had the story by early this morning. By then it was the headline, ‘American genius solves the mystery of the universe’.”

“Forty two,” Scratchy replied. “I’m just a clever code jockey who discovered a better way to program.”

“I’ve been in touch with some programmers. They would disagree. It seems what you’ve done will make many, many formerly impossible outcomes possible, and several other important projects extremely economical. Look.” Tad pointed at the southern sky, where the jets were lined up to land. “They are beating a path to your door.”

“So that’s it. I’m the next golden goose.” Scratchy glanced over at Tad.

Tad caught this glance and smiled. “I don’t do programming. In fact, my ‘software’ problems are all scatological. You know, tots love to poop.”

They walked on. “So this is a neighborly gesture.”

Tad was still smiling. “I’m just a groopie, Dr. O’hara. Glad to have a front row ticket.”

“My friends call me Scratchy...”

“Scratchy?”

“...Because I’m so lovable. Like a porcupine in your pocket.”

They had reached the cottage, a board-and-batton structure under a green hipped roof. Another Hollywood cowboy jogged up and handed Tad a note. Tad read this and passed it to Scratchy who stared at it.

“Well?” Tad asked.

“Why not?” Scratchy answered.

Tad took out a pen and scrawled a message on the back of the note.

“Tell Mr. Earl that he can set up in the clubhouse. Mr. O’hara will be there by four-thirty for the five o’clock taping.”

§ § §

Like every other self-respecting geek on the planet, Don Driscoll had downloaded the code Scratchy posted. He ran the benchmarks on the sample programs and decided the world had just become much more interesting. The original set of templates was like a child’s xylophone compared to this Steinway. It was as though an entire new color spectrum had been announced overnight. All day he watched the jets landing at the airport. Then they announced that Scratchy was going on Freddy Earl. While a small part of him basked in the reflected glory of his boss, the rest of him seethed. He could hardly stand reading Slash|Dash, as, one after one, the big kahuna nerds from around the world ladled out their adulation. It made him want to puke. He went for another beer and switched over to a football game.

§ § §

Tad had suggested that Scratchy think about his clothes, national television and all. Scratchy called down to the hemp store on State Street and asked Marcel for a Guatemalan shirt. An hour later one of the cowboy bellhops delivered this to his cottage, where Scratchy, on his laptop, was deep into an argument in the Room.

“Leave it,” Scratchy called through the door and returned his attention to the Room.

Itchy and Winston were pacing the stone floor. Jack sat in one of the Cordobaloungers and tried to make the face of his avatar look serious. Desi leaned back against the wall. He was wearing a Navajo white silk kurta top and matching pajamas, and his feet were bare. His face looked like blend of a teenaged Krishnamurti and Aamir Khan. Scratchy stood in the middle with his arms crossed, waiting for the others to assimilate his news.

“Freddy Earl! Are you completely insane?” Winston ranted.

“What are you going to wear?” Desi asked, “Not more hemp, please.”

“Actually, I think its better to have the interview behind you,” Itchy said. “The press might back off then.”

“You can’t say anything about Junana,” Winston added. Scratchy nodded.

“Jack,” he asked. “What’s your main complaint?”

Jack managed to get his avatar to raise its head to look straight at Scratchy. “Be open and honest about everything except for Junana and us. You discovered the templates on your own, so you can just tell them how that happened. And tell them that you will not be selling any commercial rights for eighteen months to allow the non-commercial marketplace to develop. That will give you time to breathe. Within a few news cycles the world should be back to its usual preoccupations.”

“Obsessed by completely pointless bullshit once again,” Winston added.

“The Game,” Itchy said. “Don’t breathe a word about the Game.”

“No Junana, no mesh computing, no Game. I’ll just thrill them with my tales of Frisbee golf at Reed.”

“And steal one of the robes for me,” Desi said. “San Jacinto Ranch, Oh, my God, I hear it’s fabulous. Over here it’s 5:30 in the morning. I’ve already been up all night. But I’ll stay up to watch. It’s going around the world, live on NNC International.”

“I have to go,” Scratchy said. “Roy Rogers is back with someone who says he does makeup.”

§ § §

“Mr. O’hara, thank you for speaking to us.” Freddy Earl had been driven up from Los Angeles after the network’s president suggested this could be the interview of the decade. The special segment of “Freddy Earl Today” would be broadcast live from Montecito.

“Thank you, um, Freddy,” Scratchy leaned forward and spoke into the dummy microphone on the desk, forgetting that he wore a lavaliere mike on his shirt.

“Mr. O’hara,” Freddy Earl continued. “How does it feel to be the man of the hour?”

“Call me Mike,” Scratchy said.

Desi settled back in his overstuffed armchair. “Oh, Mikey, not the Guatemalan shirt. That’s so Eighties.”

“Mike, you are a genius. That’s obvious to the world,” Freddy said. “Can you tell us, in a way we can understand, how you discovered these famous templates, and what they mean?”

“Let me start by saying I’m not any sort of ‘Sapphire Child.’ I’m just a nerd with a hyperactive curiosity. I didn’t do this on my own. I had an idea about how to improve on the work of lots of other folks.”

“Modesty. I don’t see a lot of that. What people tell me is that we can expect great things now from these templates of yours. Revolutionary advances in computing and science.”

“Mikey can be as modest as the next genius,” Desi said to himself, “when he wants to be.”

“The best thing about the templates is that they are a kick to use,” said Michael.

“We have a caller,” Freddy cupped his hand around the tiny microphone in his left ear. He nodded and cleared his throat. “It seems we have a very special caller. It’s the White House. We are waiting for the President.”

Scratchy sat back in his chair and crossed his arms over his chest. He was scowling slightly.

“Oh, no, Mikey. Mikey, don’t!” Desi was shaking his head at the television, wishing he could call up Winston. They had all seen that look in class at Reed just before Michael O’hara tore the spleen out of somebody’s finely crafted argument.

“President Stone, are you there?”

“Howdy, Freddy.” The familiar Texas voice rang out.

“Good evening, Mr. President. I guess you have some questions for my guest.”

“Always a pleasure to talk to a true American genius.”

“Michael, do you have a word for the President?”

Scratchy bent forward.

“Sure,” He spoke grimly. “I didn’t vote for you or your dad. And before I have anything to say to you at all, personally or professionally, you’d need to do a few things besides kiss the asses of your rich friends...”

“Mikey, you wonderful fool.” Desi couldn’t stop laughing.

Freddy eyebrows flicked up, and his eyes shifted to the producer, who was intent on the exact words now flowing from Scratchy’s lips, ready to push the button if one of the big five no-nos came out. He was grinning, however, and just nodded back at Freddy.

“...First you’d need to pull the troops back from the Middle East, where they don’t belong. Second, you’d need to show you are serious about fighting global warming. And finally, you want to put the money back into the NSF cyberinfrastructure program—you know, the money you took out to pay for that tax cut for your buddies. Until then, this is my 15 minutes of fame, and you are the last person on the planet I want to share it with.” Scratchy sat back in his chair again and closed his eyes.

“Mr. President,” Freddy said. “Mr. President?” The phone operator was running his finger across his throat to signal that the call was lost.

“It looks like we’ve lost our connection to the White House.” Freddy hid a small smile on the left side of his mouth. “I’ve heard they call you ‘Scratchy,’ he continued, “Now we know why.”

§ § §

Don Driscoll, two six-packs later, stared at the screen in disbelief. Scratchy O’hara had just dissed the President of the United States. That pompous shit had the nerve to speak his mind in front of about a billion people. This little conversation will be on the Web for an eternity. Stone was sure to respond. He didn’t get to be President the kiss-the-babies way. He and his close advisors had stabbed and clawed their way to the top, leaving broken opponents all over the body politic. They spread more fear with their campaign advertisements than most terrorist organizations would ever accomplish. Anybody who had tracked the career of W.G. Stone at all could figure Scratchy had just opened up a can of whoop-ass on himself.

Nick knew there was trouble when he logged in. Cindy’s congratulatory smile had been replaced by a grim frown. It felt like she was taller, but he knew it was her mood. Not even a hello. She nodded at him and the screen went black.

When it brightened they were back on the bluff top, the same desert scene from the first day of Level Two. For a second he thought she was taking him back a level. She strode to the edge and looked down. He followed her gaze. The red sandstone escarpment verged down nearly vertically for hundreds of feet, and then gentled into a bouldered shoulder on a loop of a placid opalescent green river. Below them a red-tailed hawk cruised. It cried out. The shrill song echoed around them.

“Anything come to mind?” she asked.

“Great base-jumping spot,” he offered.

“This is Level Three. Level Three is to Level Two like Halo is to Tetris. To even start Level Three, you need to show me you can think on your feet.”

“What...?”

Cindy had pushed him off the cliff. Nick’s avatar tumbled for what seemed like minutes before deflecting off a boulder and then crumpling into a pile of scree near the edge of the river. The scene replayed itself in third person slow motion and Nick watched his avatar break several bones and bleed out on the rocks. Then he was back on the bluff with her.

“Freakin’ rude,” he complained.

“That’s not a question. I need a question from you. Now!” She pushed him again.

“Ask the question,” she yelled.

“How far down is it?” he called out. His avatar tumbled head first and brained itself on a hoodoo. Then he was up on the bluff again.

“I’m not doing a geography lesson. Try again.” She pushed him.

“What is gravity?” he yelled. Splat. Back on top.

“Too theoretical. You are tumbling toward your death and you want to know about gravity?” She pushed. He tried to duck, but his motor reflexes had been slowed. Over he went.

“How do I stop?” he yelled. Splat. Back on top.

“Laws of physics. You can’t just stop. This ain’t toontown.” Push.

“Can I fly?” Splat. Back on top.

“Much better! But still imprecise. Try again.” Push.

“How do I fly?”

“Perfect!”

Nothing happened. Splat. Back on top.

“You said it was ‘perfect’!”

“Perfect question. Lousy timing. Try it now.”

“How do I fly?”

A console appeared in front of them, hovering within reach.

“Ask your question again, and pay attention. Next time you fall and die you end up back a level.”

Nick navigated into a Query about the physics of flight. He then Queried about timing and tactics, which led to a template structure in game theory. He spent the next two hours unfolding this.

“Excellent,” Cindy smiled again. “You are armoring yourself against my next move. I am such a good Guide. But I should have tossed your sorry ass off that cliff months ago.”

Nick laughed and stepped back from the console, putting Cindy between him and the cliff. Still laughing, he thrust his hand out and shoved her over the edge.

“Silly cowboy,” She fell backwards, but managed to wrap her toes around his waist, taking him over with her. “Remember your lesson.”

Flight is a simple matter of swimming in the air. Below him, Cindy morphed into a kestrel and banked left.

“No fair!” he yelled. The swimming in air concept required that he either create an airfoil that reduced his relative gravity or... “That’s it!” He typed in a set of quick commands.

“That’s better.” The air around him started to shimmer and coalesce. “Colder,” he typed. Now the air was thick as pudding, a soup of dense gasses. He circled his arms in a treading pattern and slowed his descent to the point where he could reach out and grab at a ledge that was drifting by.

Cindy stood on a nearby hoodoo. “Quick thinking, Nicky. Good thing you don’t need to breath this.” She swept her hand through the fog. “What is it?”

“Radon. Nearly frozen. Heavy as lead.”

“How did you figure out that you could change the composition of your environment?”

“You can change your form. I can’t. It was the only way to create flight. I figured you wouldn’t give me an insolvable problem.”

“Looks like you’ve earned yourself a bit of Free-for-All time.” She moved close and put both hands on his face. “I’m so very proud of you, Nicky.” She bent forward and planted a kiss on his forehead. “Go have yourself a good time.” He found himself alone on the bluff top.

Level Three, he mused. He’d heard the horror stories, the blogs in Junana were buzzing with them. Maybe half the Gamers who got here ended up back in Level Two again, polishing up their template unfolding, ready to get tossed off the cliff, or run down by the train, or trapped in the mine, or the submarine, or the safe, or whatever it took to realize that you can stretch your mind around the puzzle and, snap, find the solution. Like he just did. Cindy is such a good Guide. He realized how lucky he was.

Jack Dobron shook his head, picked up a phone, and pushed an office-internal number.

“Get a jet to Santa Barbara, tell them to wait there for orders.”

He set down the phone, jogged the replay on the digital recorder, rewound the last five minutes, and watched again as Scratchy declared war on the President of the United States. God, he wished he’d done that to Stone years ago. Instead, Jack wrote him off as an imbecile. Now he had to figure Stone’s intentions into his plans for the next six months.

§ § §

Wilson Garrick Stone, the President of the United States, stared at the phone on his desk like it was a viper about to strike. It had been his idea to make the call. His chief of staff warned him that their intel on this O’hara fellow was thin. Still, they did not have any information that he was hostile. He was a nerd, for Chrissake, with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to speak with the President. And this, this nobody had the nerve to talk to him like that. Well, he thought, Mr. O’hara, enjoy your fifteen minutes of fame. It will be followed by a somewhat longer period of pain. He snatched up the phone receiver.

“Get me Karl,” he snarled and waited. “Karl. You were right. You’re my hound dog now. I want to know everything there is to know about this so-called genius. I want the IRS and the NSA on this, Homeland Security too. Remember what you did to that school bus driver that flipped me off out in the motorcade? Well, double that in spades. Did he say NSF? Are we giving him money? If he’s on any kind of government grant or contract, make sure it’s audited and shut down. Family, friends, friends of friends. I want everyone around this prick to feel the burn. Nobody talks to me like that. You need more firepower, tell the Vice President I said you can use his private squad. They’re vicious little shits, I’m sure they can tear one goddamn California nerd a new one.”
