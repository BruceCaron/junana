# Five
For the next Nerdfest, Mr. Slick had picked another beach resort, this one on the Kona side of the big island of Hawaii. Most Kona hotels were enormous resorts fronting narrow beaches, and throttled by expensive golf courses. The Kona Cove resort was just the opposite, a scattering of free-standing hales around an actual cove with a fresh water lagoon, a beach, and a reef. Four bars, two swimming pools for the kids and their grandparents, a little pakalolo from the waterfront staff, and a real chef cooking up fresh mahi mahi and opa; what more does anyone need? No cell phones, no newspapers, and no Internet, apart from one broadband connection in the business office next to the store.

The first night, Scratchy sneaked in and slipped a custom high-speed WiFi base station on the electrical plug of the office computer. He picked it up from Make.com and did some customization. It looked and worked just like a multi-jack electrical outlet surge suppressor, but also broadcast an encrypted WiFi signal when connected to an Ethernet cable with an Internet connection.

The four of them occupied four adjacent hales fronting the cove. They had breakfasted together on the terrace of the cafe and returned along the beach to Mr. Slick’s hale where they set up Desi’s laptop on the deck shaded by palm trees. Winston was 5000 miles away and six hours later in Philadelphia. Right on time, he called in. He was sitting at his desk, his computer camera focused on a steaming mass of something on a white-paper napkin.

“Is that Cheez-Whiz?” Scratchy asked.

“Straight from Jim’s on South Street. You guys don’t mind if I eat while we talk.” He picked up half of the cheesesteak and took a monster bite.

“If I hadn’t just had eggs benedict and French toast, I’d be in the mood to protest.” Scratchy smiled.

“I miss you, Winston!” said Desi.

“Hi, Lucy, you look fantastic.”

Desi was wearing a bright blue lungi around his waist and sported a new tattoo, a willow pattern, on one shoulder. “Thank you, Fred!”

“Boys, Mr. Slick, I wish I were there,” Winston said. “Anyhow, this new video hook-up is phenomenal. I’m almost ready to put on some sunblock.”

Over the next two hours, the five of them outlined the work they had completed or would soon complete, using terms that Mr. Slick could understand. They shared a concern that programming Junana.com was taking up far too much of their time right now.

“Tell me again why we are building a social networking software?” Mr. Slick asked.

“The templates work better when they are matched to the desires and skills of the individual player. That seems to be a fundamental principle,” Itchy explained. “But we don’t want to distract the players from enjoying the start of the game by forcing them to tell us what we need to know.”

“Can’t afford extra baggage in any game design,” Scratchy warned. “We need maximum acceleration from a dead start. Little fuckers got no attention span until they hit level two. Of course, then you can’t pry the controls out of their fists.”

“There are a dozen social networking services that are huge in different parts of the globe,” Winston said. “Why not just pull information from them?”

“We’ve looked at automating the transfer of profile information from other services. Problem is, most profile information is bogus,” Desi said. “On Junana, we’ll make it a rule to be honest.”

“What kind of word is ‘Junana’?” asked Mr. Slick.

“It’s a combination of Sanskrit and Japanese,” Desi explained. “’Jnana’ means ‘knowledge’ in Sanskrit and ‘Juunana’ means ‘seventeen’ in Japanese. The whole point is providing knowledge to seventeen-year-old kids around the world. So we made up ‘Junana’.”

“Junana.com will be everything Myplace tried to be,” said Scratchy. “It will offer a whole new level of identity checking, so your friends on the net would know you are you and not some forty-year old pervert from Pacoima. And if you are a perv, we’ll have your police record and kick you off the service. We can add levels of real information about schools and classes so that students, who are taking, say, the same history class at Roosevelt High School in Albany, can share homework assignments or gripes.”

“We can leverage Desi’s multi-language automatic translation, Itchy’s avatar code, and also provide a 3D virtual gathering place for friends to interact,” he added.

 “It will be the first truly global social networking service,” Desi explained, “running on the first global mesh computer.”

“We mine Junana, so that when the player starts the Game we know enough about her to tailor Level One to her personal desires,” Itchy said. “It’s going to be fantastically seductive.”

“What is the final scale to all this?” Mr. Slick asked.

“Not sure,” Scratchy noted. “We are going places beyond what anyone has built before or probably has imagined could be built.”

“I think we could run out of people before we run out of CPU or RAM,” Desi said.

“People who want to play?” Mr. Slick asked.

“No, people on the planet.” Desi smiled. “There are only about six billion of them. And everybody will want to play. Tell him, Mikey.”

“Tell me what?” Mr. Slick slid back on his chaise into the shade. He was wearing a Tommy Bahama swimsuit and a Cuban shirt, but he didn’t look like he wanted any sun.

“Remember those mini-movies we showed you?” Scratchy started. “We’ve been trying to link them into a larger template system.”

“Scratchy made a copy of the Internet, and Desi used the templates to break everything into granules,” Winston said. “Desi found a way to expose the semantic relationships between the granules.”

“Itchy created a user interface, something between a holodeck on Star Trek, a first-person shooter, and a Hollywood production,” said Desi said. “It’s simply marvelous!”

“In this alpha version the topic you chose opens up a series of problem spaces,” Itchy said. “They have to do combat or discovery by fielding the questions presented by the game pieces we call “Guides.” Every question has a time limit, based on its gravitas.”

“How’s that?” Mr. Slick asked.

“There may be no such thing as a ‘stupid question,’ but there are a lot of insipid topics,” Scratchy added. “And insipid topics unfold really uninteresting templates.”

“Give me an example,” Mr. Slick asked.

“The meaning of life,” Winston said.

“The existence of God,” Itchy added.

“The future of society,” Desi said.

“The notion of ‘evil’,” Scratchy added, “or ‘good’ for that matter. Most of the big questions that philosophy and religion have been consumed by for the last 2000 years turn out to be universally uninteresting.”

“Which might be one reason why template knowledge was not discovered earlier,” Winston proposed. “But there are important topics and templates with some gravitas.”

“These are really heavy, man!” Scratchy said in his best Wavy Gravy imitation.

“The important ones fall into two groups, the templates that are foundational and those that are capstones,” Winston explained.

“The ones you must do first or can only do last,” Desi said.

“We know very few of the capstones,” Scratchy admitted. “And not nearly enough of the foundational ones.

“The original eight templates from Template Technology are capstone templates,” Itchy explained. “Scratchy’s Noel template is a foundational template.”

“He’s so smart...” Desi rolled his eyes and smiled.

“When we’ve figured everything out, we should be able to encapsulate all of what is important to learn within a finite series of levels in the Game. We still need to find a pedagogy that fits into this picture,” Itchy said.

Mr. Slick frowned.

“The interactivity rocks, but the game structure has not yet emerged,” Scratchy concluded.

Mr. Slick slumped back into his chaise. He closed his eyes. His management alarm had just gone off; the bell that sounded when a staff meeting had just rolled off the tracks or a vice president was trying to snowball him. He had never been keen on the templates, and now he was concerned that these had pushed the whole effort into some obscure limbo. The internal voice was telling him to demand they junk everything and start over. That’s when Winston spoke up.

“Scratchy, please point the computer over to Mr. Slick.” Scratchy adjusted the camera.

“Mr. Slick,” Winston continued.

“Go ahead, Winston.”

“Everything you’ve just heard sounds like we’ve jumped into the deep end of the waste treatment plant. You think we are treading in shit up to our armpits.”

“Actually, I think you might need a snorkel.”

“I felt the same way before I took a ride on the prototype Game.”

“And now?”

“Now I cannot put it down. The hours I’ve spent on the Game have been the most fascinating, productive, seductive, well, mind-fucking time I’ve ever spent. It’s like...” He paused, unable to find the right phrase.

“Holing out from a bunker...,” Scratchy suggested.

“Sinking an eagle putt...,” Itchy said.

“Winning the Open...,” Desi added.

“All of the above,” Winston concluded. “So don’t make any final judgements until Scratchy hooks you up for a trial run.”

Mr. Slick sighed. Winston was right. The lads deserved some respect.

“How long will it take?” he asked.

“Why don’t I call back three days from now, same time of day,” Winston suggested. “If you’re not completely convinced, then we’ll rethink the whole enchilada.”

“But first, Mr. Slick here needs to come clean,” Scratchy said.

The other Nerds looked over at him.

“You know we can’t ask him who he is,” Desi whispered.

“That’s not what I mean,” Scratchy replied. “Is it, Mr. Slick?”

Mr. Slick and Scratchy shared a moment of eye contact as the rest watched.

“And what do you mean?” Mr. Slick asked.

“You like people to think you’re a modernist, a liberal, something of a philosopher. But inside, you are a true believer. I’m guessing longtime Catholic. Altar boy and wannabe priest at least at some point.”

Mr. Slick was still frowning. Scratchy continued. The others stole glances among themselves.

“What you really wanted was to find a new highway to God. You wanted a cosy new home within modernity for Jesus. Soon as we tell you the templates don’t know what to do with God and evil, you think the templates are flawed.”

“We are looking to make an impact,” Mr. Slick reminded them.

“Hey,” Scratchy said. “Don’t worry about God, I’m certain he’ll show up down the road.”

“Besides, God has to be everywhere, or she’s nowhere,” Desi added.

“Perhaps God is in the templates,” Itchy added. “We didn’t invent these, we don’t own them, we only found them.”

Mr. Slick leaned back in his chaise and looked down the beach, following a mother in a pink bikini showing her two young children the tidal pool where two six-foot moray eels named Bert and Ernie kept house. He had the feeling he’d just stuck his head in Bert’s mouth. His thoughts went to the Cardinal, not the old man whose faith in him he had been forced to destroy, but the young chapel priest who saved him in his infancy.

§ § §

Jakov Dobranić was born in Zagreb in March 1941 and promptly orphaned when a Henkel 111 bomber dropped a 500-kg bomb on the city’s central hospital. His father, a non-commissioned officer in the Yugoslav army, had been sent into battle near Sarajevo and was never heard from again. With the assistance of the local bishop, the babies rescued from the ruins of the neonatal ward were taken to a Jesuit orphanage in Rome.

Jakov grew up literally in the church, at a time when orphans, like warplanes, were mass produced. Not particularly handsome as an infant, it was his bright demeanor and indefatigable energy that kept him from being shipped to one of the church’s “rural relocation centers,” Dickinsian workhouses that survived off the labor of their charges. The favorite of the chapel priest, Jakov was nearly swallowed into a life of piety, except that he caught the notice of the Contessa Daniela Ottavio, a frequent visitor to the chapel. Having lost all three sons, her daughter, and seven grandchildren to the conflict and the aftermath, her chapel devotions were powered by grief and tinged with a smoldering anger.

Bereft of family, she admired the toddler who struggled to emulate the behaviors of the older choirboys. The Contessa paid handsomely to adopt the child, and after a few years of doting personal attention, a short childhood as pleasant and happy as his infancy had been miserable, she sent the rechristened Jacopo Ottavio off to an elite institution in rural Austria where children of wealthy families from across Europe were made ready to meet their adult obligations.

After graduating from the St. Gilgen Academy on the banks of the Wolfgangsee, Jacopo attended the Sorbonne in the early 1960s, and then moved to the United States, where he did an MBA at Wharton. Jacopo was a perennial invitee to the Vatican’s annual summer conclaves for the brightest young stars from the church’s top dioceses. The program had been devised to marshall young talent the Church could call upon in the arenas of finance and politics outside the strictures of priesthood.

In 1966, Jacopo Ottavio returned to Paris, bedded and nearly wedded a cousin of the Rothschilds, and joined and later quit the Parti Communiste Français. Already, it seemed, he could not decide how to position his life within or without the adventure of capitalism. He announced his Marxism to be of the Grouchoist variety and in May 1968 joined a student brigade in the streets of the Left Bank. Arrested, beaten, and deported, he returned to Rome, where he renounced the PCF for its mistaken, although thoroughgoing, sense of self importance and its blinkered perspective on Stalinism.

Scorned by his former Communist comrades he returned to the marketplace, which is exactly where his now octogenarian adopted mother, the Contessa, had always known he would arrive. He was, she had long sensed, too clever for the Communists and too ambitious for the Church. Jacopo married in 1972, a suitable arrangement that brought him two children whom he adored. His wife and the Contessa managed to become fast friends. Having grandchildren around her mended an enormous tear in the fabric of the old woman’s life.

Although she never once announced her love for Jacopo, the Contessa’s will was as simple as the probate was complicated. Her fortune and the family crest were now entirely his to control. The church where little Jakov had spent his youngest days boasted a new orphanage and school. The Contessa’s name graced new buildings at the universities her children had attended.

The Bishop, now a Cardinal, visited Jacopo in his offices on the Via Frattina in late 1989. He surprised his friend with the news that the Church had forgiven him his youthful indiscretions. Jacopo’s brief flirtation with Communism was to be forgotten.

While Jacopo embraced the friendship of the old priest, he was less than enthusiastic about returning to the Church. He had been orphaned by war, rescued by caprice, disciplined and molded for success by his adopted mother as a escape route from her omnipresent grief, and was now preparing for the only future he could imagine that would hold his fascination. The rapid collapse of the ideals of socialism and the communist states of Europe heralded a new age of savage capitalism. Count Jacopo Ottavio’s life was now focused on what would emerge from this unbridled marketplace and how this might lead to something that would replace the promise of socialism. The Church, he predicted to his old friend, would find in the new gods of the market a much greater enemy than godless Communism ever posed. The old man was stunned by Jacopo’s rejection, and their meeting ended in acrimony.

Jacopo Ottavio consolidated and streamlined the estate’s business interests and began his policy of retreating from public view. Her many properties in Europe, Asia, and the Americas were sold to a holding company which then sold them to a real-estate investment trust. Both were privately owned by Jacopo. The stocks were sold to a private mutual fund also run by Jacopo. Only the ancestral holdings in Italy were retained under the name of Ottavio, although the equally ancestral tenants who worked the farms and vineyards in the hills above Firenze would not see the Count more than once a decade.

Jacopo’s wife had settled into the Contessa’s house in Rome, where she entertained a wide circle of friends. Jacopo was always welcome, although his presence was rarely required. His two children were now adults. His son managed the Italian estates and his daughter taught sociology in England at the London School of Economics.

Jacopo took the name Jack Dobron as the first among several aliases and commenced a life as a nomadic marketplace speculator. He focused on emerging opportunities in technology, communications, and the post-Communist territories. His new motor yacht, Le Grand Azure, 371 feet long, had its own helicopter and stowed a 70-foot sailboat and a 60-foot motor launch. This became his floating headquarters, although he spent more time in hotels and jetliners.

Within a decade he controlled assets that put him within reach of the wealthiest families on the planet, although his personal wealth was unknown to governments and to the press. His companies paid their taxes, gave to charities, and grew fat on the global hunger for consumption.

Jack Dobron soon became alarmed and then morose over the direction the marketplace was leading the world. He figured that klaxon alarms should be sounding in the halls of government in every nation as environmental degradation, social anomie, political polarization, cultural fundamentalism, and economic imbalances escalated across the body politic. Instead, the richest nations remained fixated on expanding energy use, increasing worker productivity, and marginalizing minority opinions. The less-rich nations copied their richer neighbors and added low wages to their national portfolios as if this were some new virtue.

No serious thought was being given to any notion of collective social change. Capital flows went global, with the financial markets exchanging trillions of Euros each day. As each nation pimped its economic climate, every locale was forced to whore for the attention of global capital. Towns and counties beggared themselves to attract jobs, offering tax holidays and free services to corporations that had no intention of remaining once the holiday was over.

Jack met Winston Logan Fairchild at a Wharton briefing in Brussels, and they fell into a day-long conversation over the need to get ahead of the marketplace stampede, to try to turn this before it reached the looming cliff straight ahead. They continued their conversation over the years, meeting in cities where they had other business interests. When the dot-com bubble reached its zenith, Winston advised Jack to pull his assets out, saving Jack more than he saved Itchy, Scratchy, and Desi combined. Of the ten trillion dollars in assets that bled away from the NASDAC, none of these belonged to Jack.

Three months later, Jack flew Winston up to Newport, where Le Grand Azure was at anchor. For the first time since he began his peculiar career, Jack revealed his financial holdings to another person. Winston would need to know everything so that he would rest his friendship with Jack on trust. In return, Winston spilled to story of his life, from the privileged Philadelphia Main Line upbringings (his mother and the Contessa would have gotten along famously) to his liberating years at Reed, his training at Wharton, and his work in economics at Cambridge.

The desire to find a new purchase on the old ideal of positive social change had grown within Jack to the point where he felt he could easily give up his entire fortune to make this happen. At this point, if he had any faith that the Church could be the agent of this change, he would have gladly turned his wealth over to it. But the Church was now mired in a death struggle with internal and external fundamentalisms. No, a new agent for social change would need to be invented, nurtured, cultivated, and then propagated across the globe. Winston felt he knew the people who could instigate such an agent. He invited them all to Kyoto, one of Jack’s favorite cities, for their first meeting.

Mr. Slick looked back at Winston’s face in the computer monitor. He nodded as if he’d consummated some formal commitment to himself.

“Winston,” he said. “It’s time we all get to know each other better.” And he told them all the story of an infant rescued from a Zagreb hospital and raised by a priest and a contessa. He answered all their questions patiently. Then there was a long silence.

“You can call me Jack, if you like,” he remarked, “But I have grown very fond of ‘Mr. Slick’.”

“We could make that Count Slick,” Desi said.

“Jack it is,” Scratchy announced. “The ‘ad-venture capitalist.’ Are you ready for the alpha Game?”
