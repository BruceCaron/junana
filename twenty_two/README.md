# Twenty Two
Desi and Scratchy had spent the past two days tag-teaming the reboot of Junana on the mesh. At four in the morning on Monday, Scratchy needed sleep. For Desi, in Sao Do, it was just six in the evening. He kept the process on track until Scratchy woke up. By Monday evening Santa Barbara time, they were ready to upload the backed-up master databases, a process that would take all night, even with the enormous throughput of the global mesh computer. They also replaced the Unix SQL error message with an image of Wanda’s face, winking. This sent the geek-blogs into frenzy mode.

Itchy and his top Sao Do team cleaned up the comments on the source code revision that Don Driscoll had stolen. When Don didn’t show up for work the next day, Scratchy checked his logs and confirmed what they suspected. Now that they had finished porting to mesh, all that hardware they owned was no longer needed. A crack Sao Do team was assigned sysadmin duties. Junana’s old content and administrative server operations were told to erase and scrub their disks and remain offline. Employees were given a month’s notice and six months severance pay.

At noon New Orleans time on Mardi Gras Tuesday, Desi and Scratchy were in the Room. They were concerned about turning on Junana everywhere at the same time, in case even the mesh could not handle that many simultaneous logins. They decided to roll it out by time zone, starting with U.S. Eastern Standard Time.

“You’ve got a plane to catch,” Desi said. “I’ll keep an eye on the load.”

“Hello, New York,” Scratchy keyed in the final command. All over the Eastern U.S., Junana clients sprang back to life with a login page. “When is Itchy going to release the code?”

“Most of it’s up now. All of it will be up within the hour.”

“I’m still surprised Jack suggested this.”

“We’ve been underestimating him.”

“Since day one. Someone’s calling—maybe that’s my cab.” He picked up the phone.

“This is the front desk. Your Jacaranda Cab is here,” the voice said.

“I’ll be down.” Scratchy was already living out of his suitcase, so he just grabbed his shaving kit and toothbrush, slipped his laptop into his delivery bag, and headed to the lobby. The cab was waiting under the port cochere. The driver stood by the door looking bored.

“Where’s Timmy?” Scratchy asked. Timmy was his usual driver.

“Got a fare up to Solvang.” The driver grabbed his bag and tossed it into the trunk. “Airport?”

Scratchy settled back in the cab as it rolled down the long, curving, palm fringed driveway. At the street, the cab stopped for traffic. The door opened and a blonde in a dark coat slipped into the back seat.

“Get your own cab, sister,” Scratchy said.

“Very funny, Mr. O’hara,” said Captain Nancy Rankin. She opened up her purse so Scratchy could see the Glock. The cab accelerated out of the driveway and headed south, away from the airport.

“You one of Karl’s stooges?” Scratchy asked. He didn’t like the feel of this at all. The driver had a small earpiece. Scratchy noticed another car was following them.

“Just enjoy the scenery.” She opened up a black leather case and removed a silver cylinder with a small glass vial on one end. “And don’t even think about getting heroic.”

Scratchy noticed the broken cup holder on the door. “This is Timmy’s cab.”

“He’ll get it back.” Timmy was drugged and sleeping in the trunk under a blanket, his head resting on a backpack with a million dollars in unmarked hundreds. Rankin had access to another forty-nine million to wire to Don Driscoll’s offshore account.

“If you are planning to fly me to Romania and torture me, the airport’s in the other direction,” Scratchy said.

“We’re not the CIA,” Rankin replied. “We can torture you in Tarzana...” She poked the metal cylinder against Scratchy’s right forearm. It fired the drug cocktail into his system.

“Hey!” he grabbed the spot with his left hand. “That was rude.”

“...Or we can have a chat right here in the cab.” She glanced at her watch. By the time they hit Ventura he’d be singing like Vanilla Ice.

Scratchy’s eyes began to close and he settled back into the corner of the seat.

“Torture me in Tarzana,” he whispered hoarsely. “Molest me in Modesto. Squeeze my lemon, baby, till the juice run down my leg.” His head slumped back.

In ten minutes she switched out the cylinders and gave him a jolt of epinephrine to bring him back just enough to talk. She checked the level in the vial. She still had enough for the “hot shot.” After he told her what she needed she would make his heart explode in his chest. Scratchy twitched and his eyes opened slightly.

“Let’s start with an easy one. What’s your name?” She clicked on the digital recorder.

“Michael O’hara to you,” he answered. “My friends can call me Scratchy.” His left hand gestured in front of his face and his eyes attempted to follow it.

“Where were you going today?”

“Hawaii, for a nice vacation.”

“Vacation? From what?”

“I’ve been coding my ass off for days.”

“Really. And now you’re finished?”

“Damn Straight!”

“What did you finish?”

“Got Junana to reboot on the mesh.” He turned his head and tried to focus on the cars moving alongside.

“What?” She flipped up her phone and punched in a quick dial number. “Give me the status on Junana?” she barked. She waited.

“Shit!” She hissed.

She turned back to O’hara. “Tell me. How did you do that?” They had been advised Junana would take months to repair if it was even possible. They had destroyed petabytes of content.

“Slickest piece of programming in my life, rebooting a mesh computer on the mesh.”

She had no idea what he was talking about. She checked the recorder to be certain it was getting this.

“I’d like to take a look at the Junana source code.”

“Go right ahead,” he said.

“Thank you. What’s your user name and password?”

“Badges!” he gestured wildly, “We don’t need no stinking badges.” His head turned and his eyes roamed around the back of the cab.

“What’s your user name and password?” she asked again.

“You want to look at the Junana source code.”

“That’s right.”

“Fuck Driscoll!” he shouted, waving his fist. “Lousy turncoat.”

“Driscoll?” She stiffened.

“Company mole, stole our code.”

“He took your code. And what did you do?”

“Fixed him good.”

“How?”

“SourceForged it.”

“Source what?”

He spelled the URL out slowly.

“Come again?”

“Resource locator for our source code. By now it’s been Slash|Dashed too.”

“What!” She pulled a laptop from the same leather case and opened it. “Say it again?” He told her. She spent several minutes browsing the site.

“Is this for real?”

“Search it, you don’t believe me.”

She keyed in the query. The top link was Slash|Dash. The news of the Junana code release was all over the front page. There were photos of O’hara and two others.

“Who are the two other programmers?”

“That would be Itchy and Desi.”

She was reading the main blog. Ichiro Nomura and Desikacharya Venkataraman were prominently mentioned.

“You just saved the taxpayers fifty million dollars,” she said. To the driver, “Take the next exit.”

The cab pulled off the freeway at Rose Avenue and stopped on the margin of the off-ramp. A black sedan pulled up behind it. The driver of the taxi and the driver of the sedan pulled Timmy from the trunk of the cab. They set him in the driver’s seat of the cab.

Rankin was on the phone, reporting about the Junana code release. She tossed the blond wig she had been wearing on the floor of the cab and stepped out. She pulled a bulging backpack from the trunk and closed the lid.

The sedan took off, leaving the cab idling. Twenty minutes later, a CHP cruiser found it still idling, Timmy was dozing in the driver’s seat. Scratchy was out cold in the back, splayed over on his side. The Officer turned off the motor, checked their pulses, and called for an ambulance.

Don Driscoll ordered up a steak sandwich from room service. He had waited an extra hour before calling the number the woman on the phone had given him. The voice said it was “no longer a working number.” He then pulled out his laptop and began to browse the Internet. The word about Junana was up top on the news feeds. Not only was the site back up, but the source code had been posted on SourceForge.

Why would they do that? The code was legitimately worth billions. Now it was public property. His illegal copy was worthless. Anybody with a modem could download the code for free. Goddamn O’hara! Don paced his room, his very expensive room, which he was planning to pay for in cash from the million they were to deliver.

Nervously, he checked his private email, nothing but spam. Then he logged into Junana. Instead of his home page there was a black screen. Then a video window appeared, a talking head shot of Michael O’hara in that stupid Guatemalan shirt. Don turned up the sound.

“...Don, old buddy, old pal,” O’hara was speaking. “You screwed the wrong pooch this time. The code you stole from us is now free for everybody. Your profile in Junana has been locked, with a message that you are a worthless sack of shit who shouldn’t be trusted with the key to the WC. We have included a bonus surprise for you, you rascal you.” O’hara wagged a pudgy finger at him.

“Every Guide in the Game has been instructed to let their players know who you are and what you did. Any time you use a cell phone, swipe your credit card, use an ATM, or go online for any reason, the Game will know where you are, and will broadcast this information to all players within a half mile radius of your location.

“We are not going to prosecute you. We want you out on the street. Try to ignore the strangers that take a sudden interest in you. They only hate you a little. All you need to do is stay offline, use pay phones, pay in cash, and never, ever apply for another job. Oh, and have a nice life.” The screen went black.

There was a knock on the door. “Room service!” the voice said. Don peeked through the viewer. The waiter held a tray with a covered plate. Don opened the door.

“It’s about fucking time you got here,” he said.

The waiter nodded at him, breezed in, set the tray on the table and arranged the silverware and napkin.

“Do you require anything else?” The waiter stared at him for an instant and then looked at the ceiling. Don pulled a couple dollars from his wallet and handed then to the guy, who nodded, smirked, and breezed back out of the room.

Don went to the minibar and grabbed a Heineken. He sat down and took a long pull. O’hara was trying to make him paranoid. Doing a good job of it too. Don took the little mustard jar and twisted off the lid, he dug the knife into it and smeared mustard on top of the steak. On impulse he took the blade of the knife and lifted the steak from its bed of lettuce. Between the steak and the lettuce were five fat, ugly-red cockroaches.

Desi burst into Itchy’s room, still shrouded in pre-dawn gloom.

“Wake up! Wake up!”

Itchy rolled over in his bed, moaning.

“They took Scratchy!”

Itchy sat up. “What?”

“I just retrieved a message from Jack. Scratchy never made it to the plane. The hotel says he checked out and took a cab. Karl’s got him, shit, shit, shit!” Desi stomped around the room, hyperventilating.

“Let’s get Jack into the Room.” Itchy pulled a lungi from a chair near his bed and wrapped this around his waist. Desi punched in the text message code on his phone.

“What did you expect?” Annaline was wearing her robe, barefoot and regal. “That he would come and take you back to San Francisco? Abandon his family? Live with you forever?”

“He said he had a surprise.”

“Could be a box of chocolates. Get real, girl.”

“What will become of me?”

“’If you can’t appreciate what you’ve got, then you’d better get what you appreciate.’”

“Tell me what you mean. I know you are smarter than I am.” Sometimes Annaline was deliberately obscure.

“George Bernard Shaw.”

“Who is that?”

“You want some Free-for-All time? We haven’t finished with your last Query yet.”

“I’m too tired.”

“Then go to sleep.”

“I’m too excited.”

“Then go to Junana, the Game is not your toy.”

“You say ‘George Bernard Shaw’ like that is supposed to explain something. Now let me find out what you mean and then we can go back to the Query.”

“Fair enough.” Annaline’s image faded and the Free-for-All arena appeared.

Essie started with Shaw, not knowing where this was headed until she found Pygmalion, which lead to My Fair Lady and Ovid’s original poem in Metamorphoses. She scanned the images of Pygmalion and Galatea, his statue and then his wife.

The stories centered on the love that the sculptor had for his creation, but never touched on the feeling of the statue. Ovid never even named the statue. Shaw had inserted social transformation into the story, a tale of the rise from the working class. He personally picked Wendy Hiller to play Eliza in the film.

The Game assembled five narrative threads leading away from this story. She chose to start with Pinocchio, where a block of wood wills itself to life. After a side trip into the dramatic use of allegory, she viewed several snippets about an android named Data on the Starship Enterprise, and a very sad scene from the film Artifical Intelligence.

She set the Computo aside and lay back on her straw pallet, her toes on the coiled hoses, and she cried. She cried for many things all at once and then, still crying, put these into some order. She cried for her mother, there in the hospital, covered with sores and praying for death. She cried for the child she was, alone in that hut, shivering in the dark, clutching her hatchet. She cried for Pinocchio, Data, Galatea, and little android boy David: blocks of wood with dreams of life. And then she cried in her joy. She was also a block of wood, a dab of clay, but now she had such dreams and such wonderful pain.

“Blue fairy,” she called out.

“Essie,” Annaline replied, her image returning to the screen. “You are the blue fairy.”

“The Game...”

“...is just a game. You are Pygmalion, not the statue.”

“Mr. Steve5683?”

“Will go back to San Francisco with his family in ten days. He wants to be a friend. He has a surprise for you.”

“A box of chocolates?”

“I think not. It is also time for you to know something.” Annaline slumped on the floor of the hut.

“What is wrong?”

“Nothing is wrong, it is simply time. Your time.” She smiled beatifically. “My time is over. Yours is just beginning.”

Annaline lay on her back. “You are the best student any Guide could ask for. In time you will be a powerful Meister. Live well my dear Essie.”

“NO!” Essie screamed into the Computo, shaking it as Annaline’s form dissolved into the dust of the hut’s floor.

“Goodbye, Pinocchio.” Essie closed her eyes and cried herself to sleep.

“Two days!” Bishop shouted into the phone. “They got Junana back up in two days!” In his sermon on Sunday he had been able to take credit for calling on God to knock Junana from the Internet. How was he to explain that God’s wrath would only last forty-eight hours?

Rankin held her cool. The Reverend was very well connected and should be useful down the road. “We are analyzing the situation now. My tech staff are all over it. We have the source code.”

“Everybody has the source code,” Bishop said. That news was all over the web. “Did you find out who’s financing their operation?”

In her excitement over the code release, Captain Rankin had forgotten to push the interrogation in that direction. She also forgot to give the geek his “hot shot,” as Karl had requested. Karl was not happy.

“What do I tell W.G.?” he demanded.

“He left the hotel sixteen hours ago,” Itchy was at the Console. He scanned the Santa Barbara newspaper sites. Desi was at the next terminal checking the California Highway Patrol traffic incident site.

Jack popped into the Room. “There’s good news. I called the taxi company. Scratchy’s cab was found near Oxnard. The driver and a passenger were taken by ambulance to St. John’s hospital.”

“Hospital! Oh, my God!” Desi said.

“Neither of them are in serious condition.” Jack said. “I can’t get any more information from here. I’ve sent someone to check out the scene. We should know soon.”

“What if they tortured him? Made him talk?” Desi asked.

“We have to assume they know everything, and that they’ll be coming after us.”

“What about your family?” Itchy asked.

“They’re used to living in a high security environment. This is not the first time I’ve made enemies.”

“Well, it’s a first time for me,” Desi said. “What if they cut off his fingers?”

“Why would they cut off his fingers?” Itchy said.

“So he couldn’t program any more.” He was remembering the story of the Taj Mahal. When the workers finished building it, they say Shah Jahan chopped off their hands so they could not build another one.

Itchy checked his email. “Don Driscoll logged into Junana. He was staying at the Eastinn LAX.”

Desi’s avatar doubled over in laughter. Itchy sent his into a similar paroxysm.

“What’s so funny?” Jack said. They told him and he joined them. Then he said, “Now you see why we have to keep Junana out of the hands of people like Karl.”

“Good thing we stripped out various, non-essential sections of the code from the release package. They can still run Junana and the Game with the public release version, but they can’t duplicate our access to global databases,” Itchy said, “among other things.”

“With any luck, Driscoll has already discarded his stolen copy,” Desi added. “Once everything settles down, we’ll let Don off the hook. Until then, well I wouldn’t want to be him.”

“I spoke with Winston,” Jack said. “He’s on a flight to Burbank. He’ll be in Oxnard in the morning. I thought Michael would enjoy a friendly face. Winston will get him on the plane to Kona.”
