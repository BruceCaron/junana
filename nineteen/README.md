# Nineteen
Jennifer Bouchez spent two solid months moving up through the Game levels. The Game was nothing like Roland and Annika had described, and yet it was everything they tried to tell her.

Her Guide, Francesco, might have been the fake Italian husband she had invented years before. He knew her better than any friend she could recall. He remembered everything she had published and could hold a conversation on anything she had read. He could recall the villages where she vacationed as a child. He controlled intimate facts about classmates all the way back to her elementary school. And he knew that what she wished for above all else was someone who could remain relaxed around her, who didn’t mind her catching him looking at her hair, who could take her hand and stroll along the river.

Her First Level was a series of walks through cities as real as the East Village in February and as spectral as any Borges tale. Each city displayed an entirely localized epistemology, a way of organizing knowledge, the uncovering of which required every bit of ethnographic skill she could muster. And until she uncovered and explored this, she could not move to the next city. Then she was in Level Two, and Francesco explained how the Query engine worked. She caught on quickly to the task of refolding the unfolded templates. She marveled at the template structures while these, in turn, insinuated into her thought processes.

When Francesco insisted that she put her computer to sleep and go out and eat or visit a certain building in Paris she had never seen, she would wander out into a cityscape filled with templates. The “entry space” undulations of the doorways on the boulevards, the syncopation of the pedestrians in their mutual dance of “attentive disregard.” The posturing of the police as a “visible monopoly of force.” She could read the landscape as a template tapestry. In fact she could not avoid doing so now, and she was chagrinned about the years she had spent without this facility.

She met Jorge and Wanda and learned the hand movements. She searched this technique and learned about its use in Brazil. Francesco was jealous of Jorge. But then Brad Pitt would have been jealous of Jorge. Francesco seemed impressed that she progressed through this level in just a few weeks. He concluded that he must be a very excellent Guide, and she agreed with him, which pleased him greatly. He even let Jorge kiss her goodbye. But then he locked her in that submarine with the water pouring in and she had to drown six times before she asked the right question. Level Three was pure revelation. Her shoes arrived, and she wore them around the house. Francesco was still barefoot, and complained that Guides cannot earn shoes. Life is unfair, she agreed.

Her Level Three Query sessions pushed her to some mental limit she had never before experienced. It felt like her brain had been removed, enlarged, supercharged, and then reconnected. She was faced with the prospect of unfolding new templates from the seeds, which Francesco would reveal after hours of Querying. Francesco taught her a new speed-reading technique, and she caught up on several genres she’d never had time for. She browsed the Village Voice Bookstore on the rue Princesse and bought a potpourri of current literature in English. She could read a novel in under an hour, at a pace where its plot hit her like a dose of amyl nitrate. As fast as her mind was spinning in the Game, her dreams were also a kaleidoscope of images and scenes, a monstrous montage of actual memories and Game Queries.

When Francesco congratulated her for completing Level Three, she realized that she had been playing more or less solidly for six weeks. Roland and Annika had been sending reports for her to pass on to Claire. And with some guilt she did so, adding that Claire might also want to try the Game. Claire emailed back that she was too busy trying to figure out why nobody was buying the sequined jeans that Con|Int had predicted would be the next big fashion on the West Coast.

Now that she was on Level Four, she could call up the Game Console and create her own reports about Junana.com. She began to discover that the Game had its own internal limitations; the template structures she was confronted by covered a certain mental territory. Many of the problems in the philosophy of science, literary criticism, and reflexive sociology were explored, but there was very little in the biological sciences, psychology, or religion.

The Game revealed problem spaces in technology, architecture and urban planning, and business, but not in art or music. Queries about art tended to veer into investigations about taste. Those on religion soon migrated into either the history of religions or empirical philosophy. In short, the Game had its own personality, which she assumed was either intentional or an artifact of the interests of its programmers. The Game showed a huge intellect but little humor.

She used her Free-for-All time on the Game to try and unfold some new templates, beginning with a template concerning the problem field of “investment.” Not financial investment, but the psychological investments made by individuals in their own identities, or in the identities of others. She had an early success with a template structure on interpellation, that is, on the investments of the state in the individual. Francesco was ecstatic with praise about this, and told her that she was one of only a handful of Fourth Level players who had unfolded a new template to its source. Later he bragged to her to that their new template structure was being incorporated into Level Two, so that every player would face the task of refolding its structure.

At first, Francesco’s narcissism disturbed her. She then realized he was an idealized vision of her desires. He was gorgeous, yes, and in his role as Guide he spoke from an authority she could not match. He was also so entirely wrapped up in himself that he hardly gave her any notice except when this could be reflected back to him. She found him silly but refreshing. She reminded herself he was a Game piece, not a person. There was no “he,” only a programmed assembly of pixels. These pixels had been assembled for her. She tried imaging a different Guide, only to realize that Francesco was the perfect choice after all.

At the end of Level Four, Francesco insisted that they walk together back on the city streets where he had first taken her. It was in Venice, on Piazza San Marco, where he stumbled and fell. She waited for him to rise, but he motioned her to bend down and told her he was dying. She would need to go on without him, he said, as difficult as that might seem. She chided him for being over dramatic. A death in Venice, really. She demanded that he stop playacting and get back on his feet.

“Is good,” he said. “You are strong. Not like me.”

Then he lay back and closed his eyes. His form slowly dissolved into the bricks and she knew he was gone. Jennifer shut off her computer, went out into the late afternoon and drifted for hours through the streets of Paris. She saw herself in the reflection of a shop window, her face side lit by a street lamp.

She had been at turns saddened, angry, and confused by Francesco’s death. He was a Game piece. A clever construct. She had put on the hat and her shoes and an old sweatshirt over a T-shirt and jeans. When she caught the look in her eyes, she realized that Francesco’s narcissism was a reflection of her own. In a world that seemed to want to objectify her, she had invested even more in constructing her self-image. It was his last lesson for her. Her shoulder bag arrived the next day.

By the time Gerry Bishop arrived at Haverbrook School the Board of Directors had already voted. The school’s Learning Management System and the Internet were to go back on line on Monday. Rector Lovemark was instructed to tell the Reverend.

“Can’t you talk to him?” Ralph pleaded with Darron Boone, the chair of the board. Why did Ralph have to break the news to Bishop? After all, the board members were all volunteers with nothing at stake.

“Hector, if we don’t get the Internet back up none of our kids are going to stay. In fact we have petitions from every student and faculty member at Haverbrook. Without the net, we don’t have a school.”

“You make it sound so clear,” Ralph said. “I’m sure he’d listen to you.”

“Do your job, Hector. Let us know how he takes it.” Boone hung up.

The students call it “The Grove.” A patch of swamp maple surrounded a natural clearing. Over a rise and out of sight from the school, it was a gathering place for smoking and general truancy. This afternoon it was packed with students,—nearly the entire student body in fact, nervously standing in small groups, chattering among themselves.

“He’s arrived,” Simon announced loudly and pocketed his cell phone. The voices stilled. They were destined for punishment, all of them. But none more than Simon.

“They’ll be looking for us. It won’t be long. Let me do the talking.” Their silence signaled their agreement.

“It’s all Bishop’s fault,” someone said, and several mumbled agreement.

Peter was still in the infirmary, and so Simon was the logical target for their collective anger, as though Simon should have talked his father out of this Internet ban. Simon’s face reddened. He stood silent. Apprentice to the Dark Mage, he would not submit to insult.

“We’ll agree to go back only if they turn on the Internet,” he said.

“Winston, this is Claire. Claire Doolan.” She waited a second to see if their brief conversation on the Reed commencement-selection committee telecon had made any impact.

“Claire. Great to hear your voice.” Winston set down his coffee and settled back in his chair, glancing around at the view of Rittenhouse Square under a foot of snow. “What can I do for you?”

“This is a might embarrassing, I have to admit. They put me up to it.” She hesitated.

“Go on.”

“The committee asked me to ask you if you wouldn’t mind asking Michael O’hara to take your place as commencement speaker. There, I’ve said it. I told them it was bad form...”

“You want the Nerd King instead of the insightful financial planner?” He kept the disappointment out of his voice.

“Why don’t I just tell them to go fuck themselves?”

“Michael’s the man of the year. Sure, I can ask him.” Scratchy will eat this up, he thought.

“I also need to ask you a favor. Should probably have done this before I yanked the speaker invitation...”

“Go ahead.”

“My company is having a retreat meeting in Santa Fe to decide what we can do in response to the retail sector collapse and, you know, the Game, and all. We need expert advice, and I’m hoping you can join us.”

“Santa Fe?”

“It’s in three weeks. We can send you a plane ticket, put you up. All the doughnuts you can eat. We can’t afford much of an honorarium.”

“Sounds intriguing. Count me in.”

“Really?”

“Certainly. Give us a chance to catch up.”

“That it will.” She turned and caught her reflection in the window. She frowned at it. “It’s been quite a while.”

“Send me the details by email. I’ll talk to Scratchy, and he will contact you.”

“I’m so sorry about that. It’s really rude. I hope you don’t hate the messenger.”

“That depends. Can you make it up to me?” That came out so wrong, he thought.

“Hmmm. Unless you actually enjoy humiliation, I can think of a couple things.” One would do, she thought. Where was this going?

“Santa Fe, then,” he said.

“Santa Fe,” she said. “Ciao.” She hung up.

It was obvious by Bishop’s mood when he stepped from the limo that he had already heard of the vote.

“They’re the board,” Ralph weaseled, “What can I do?” He tried to keep step with the Reverend, who was striding briskly through the main house on his way to the school auditorium.

“They won’t be for long,” Bishop said. He burst through the auditorium doors.

The four students sitting in the front row stood at the sound. Several teachers sat at the back of the room sharing guarded whispers. The remainder of the chairs were empty.

“Hector, I said I wanted to speak to all the students.” They had reached the front row.

“Freddy, where is everyone?” Ralph demanded of one of the four students.

Freddy looked around the room and then ducked his head to stare at his shoes. “It’s a protest against the Internet ban.”

“A protest?” Bishop bellowed, “at Haverbrook?”

“Where are they?” Ralph asked again. Freddy shrugged his shoulders.

“Aren’t you Freddy Haas?” Bishop put his arm around the student’s shoulder and led him toward a side door. “I know your dad.” He tightened his grip as they walked.

“My boy, you have a choice to make, a very clear outcome will result from this decision. Do you understand?”

Freddy nodded.

“You will show me where they are and then you will graduate and, on my personal recommendation, attend the college of your choice. Or you will keep silent, and enter into a lifelong career in the building maintenance, personal transportation, or food service industries.”

Freddy gulped. They reached the door. Bishop opened it with his free hand.

“Well?”

“They’re at The Grove.”

“Lead on, dear boy.”

Simon was expecting Rector Hector or one his lackey teachers to find them and try to bully them to return to the auditorium. His cell phone rang, Peter calling from the infirmary.

“Freddy’s leading my father here,” he announced. “Stay calm.” Several of the students were edging toward the forest. If he had said “scatter” they would all be running for the North Carolina hills.

Reverend Bishop appeared at the crest of the trail, a few yards away, Freddy at his heels. He stepped into the clearing.

“So glad we could have this meeting,” Bishop spoke. The boys huddled nervously. “Much nicer than that stuffy auditorium.” He looked around the clearing and raised his hands. “Wherever two or three of you are gathered in my name...”

“Give us back the Internet.” The voice was a tremulous contralto.

“Who said that?” Bishop bellowed.

The crowd of boys backed away from the speaker. Simon stood alone, head up, Eldrick’s proxy in this battle.

“We need the Internet to learn,” he said. “Without it we have no school.”

Bishop turned to Freddy. “Take a good look, Freddy. That’s a real leader. Not a sniveling snitch like you. Leave us men to talk. Go!” Freddy fled back down the path.

“Are you all in agreement about this?” Bishop asked, his voice acquired a sudden reasonableness.

The boys nodded and grunted uncomfortably.

“Of course you shall have your Internet,” Bishop said. “What you did here today took courage. You should all be proud. You know I am proud of you all.” He was looking directly at his son. “Now, everyone back to the school. I believe cake and ice cream are in order.”

Bishop turned and strode away, listening as the boys converged on his son with laughter and shouts of victory.

The RIND Corporation’s downtown DC office on Pennsylvania Avenue was considerably smaller than the nearby FBI Headquarters, and rarely made any headlines or television backdrops. All the press releases came out of the Marina del Ray office, leaving the DC office to do what it did best: suck funding from the budgets of federal agencies for intelligence efforts the government determined were too critical not to pursue and too risky to get caught performing.

Subcontracting out those sticky bits of work that were constitutionally or simply bureaucratically questionable gave the government the illusion they could have their intelligence without the guilt. And with enough gilt, the Corporation was happy to shoulder any amount of guilt. It would off-shore the particularly loathsome work to the Israelis or, increasingly, the Taiwanese.

Today’s meeting had no official title. It was called by Harold Farmer on the request of Tom Verplanck, the President’s chief domestic advisor, and would include Harold, Tom, the Reverend Gerry Bishop, Franklin Benjamin (formerly with the Department of Education), Navy Captain Nancy Rankin (an analyst over at the NSA), and First Lady Arlene Stone. The group was less formal than a committee, but had access to more resources than most governments on the planet.

Their purpose was to explore how computer games and social networking were impacting the social fabric and economic weal of America. Tom suggested the Junana.com network for their initial focus. He mentioned that the group might also discuss “opportunities for action,” in the face of recent economic news about which Harold was also well acquainted.

Harold remained in his office until the others had all arrived. Since that day the previous summer when the Con|Int report predicted the retail collapse, the RIND Corporation had been investigating the causes for this. Their conclusion was that a whole cohort of teenagers and young adults were acting like 40-somethings. Harold’s research had long ago discovered that the enchantment of the Now faded over the decades of an individual’s life. The very same consumer who would dive into a bottomless well of debt as a young adult simply to have the latest gizmos and cars would hit 40 and drive the same Prius for the next 20 years.

It was not that 40-somethings don’t participate in the retail market, in fact, many of the largest purchases—new homes, expensive vacations, financial investments—happen during this period. Mostly, however, they tend to spend their monies after considerable reflection, which means they have managed to escape the Now. By the age of 40, if you include their teenaged children’s consumption, the Now would have stolen more than half of their lifetime income. Harold had written the first part of a book predicting what a post-Now economy might look like. The emerging situation fascinated him, as his predictions were all coming true.

A Now-less economy would need to sell its products on the basis of value and quality. Already, certain brands were having their best years: Bang & Olefsun, Bose, Apple, BMW, Williams Sonoma; there was an upside even to this dark time. The RIND Corporation was tracking a hundred or so quality-first companies, and Harold had created an index that was seeded to a select group of mutual fund investors.

The Now had tickled up frenzied passions for entirely worthless commodities, fashions and fandoms that fed on their own fleeting reflections. Without the Now, capitalism would need to invent a new magic, otherwise the future might look a lot like Sweden: drab, efficient, careful. Without the Now, people might notice that the trains don’t run, the medicines don’t cure, the food doesn’t nourish, and the schools don’t teach. A whole range of new conflicts might open between the market and the need for public services. The population might turn political again, or rather anew, in a manner not seen in the West for many decades, spilling some of the passion the populace once reserved for their hometown hockey teams, or those new riding lawnmowers, into the public sphere.

The phone on his desk rang. He picked up the receiver. “The First Lady has arrived,” his executive assistant said.

“Tell them I’ll be in shortly,” he said, and returned the receiver to its cradle.

He stood. His office looked out on the Capitol, shrouded today by a steady downpour. For half a century or more its denizens had been selected with the same care, or lack thereof, of a teenage girl picking out a new thong. The entire Congress is as much a product of the Now as is a Bratz doll, and about as useful.

After introductions in the huge, top-floor RIND conference room, Harold Farmer asked Captain Rankin to describe their choice of actions.

“We can work the supply side, take down their servers, sever their connections to the Ariadne backbone, clobber them in the courts. Or we can pull a legislative coup, make them subject to a number of contradictory federal regulations...

“I’ve got a draft bill working though a Senate subcommittee that puts interstate social networking services like Junana under the control of the FTC, the FCC, Homeland Security, and the DOC,” Franklin said. Rankin winked at him.

“...Or we can work the demand side. Start a smear campaign against Junana. Pay some mavens to flame it in their blogs. Use some word-of-mouth against those damn ugly shoes. Get the parents to pull the plug on the Game. Grab ‘em by the short hairs and pull, sorry Reverend.”

“Quite all right.” Bishop held up his hand. “Think of me as just another team player.”

“Why can’t we find a reason to just throw them all in prison?” Franklin asked.

“To begin with, we don’t know who they are,” Harold reminded them. He had a good idea about the identity of some of the technical leads, but not the financial backers. “We need to locate the corporate officers.”

“You mean the RIND Corporation hasn’t been able to ferret out their identity?” Tom said. “You don’t find that curious?”

Harold found it more than curious. Someone with real money and international business acumen was behind Junana.

“We could characterize their entire operation as a conspiracy and get a RICO indictment out of Justice,” Tom offered. “I heard they use an encryption routine that even Fort Meade can’t crack.”

“Isn’t that illegal?” Arlene asked.

“It damn well should be,” Franklin said. “Imagine what a terrorist organization could do inside Junana.”

“An executive order would be a start, get the agencies behind us.” Harold glanced over at Tom, who made a note on a pad. “Something under the umbrella of homeland security, perhaps.”

“Once we find out who the ringleaders are, we can make things mighty unpleasant for them,” Tom said.

“That’s my thought exactly,” echoed Franklin. “Hit ‘em where it hurts.”

“We have confirmed that Michael O’hara works for a company with a contract to provide administrative programming services to Junana,” Rankin noted. She glanced at her list. “WeRus NV. It’s Belgian.”

 “Karl’s got a line on this O’hara person, and we’ll soon have a list of everyone he’s in contact with,” Tom noted.

“Karl.” Franklin nodded. Bishop raised his eyebrows and a slow grin surfaced on his face.

“I have been informed that budget is no problem, so we can keep all of our options in play,” Tom said.

“How fast can we shut them down?” Bishop asked.

“We can cut them off from the Internet overnight,” Rankin offered.

“What’s the long term plan?” Harold asked.

“Long term?” Franklin glanced around the room.

“Once we shut them down, things will get back to normal,” Tom offered.

“We are already well past the last exit to ‘normal.’” Harold said.

“You mean we’ve already lost?” Arlene asked.

“What are you trying to say?” Bishop put his hand on top of Arlene’s. “You’re alarming the First Lady.”

“The purpose of attacking them is to bring them into the open. Once we know who they are, we can go after their code.”

“So we can destroy it?” Bishop asked.

“No, so we can use it.” Harold said.

“Why not just hack it?” Rankin asked.

“We’ve tried, believe me.”

“So we steal it,” Rankin offered.

“Or buy it,” Tom said.

“We’ve put out feelers on the tech blogs and listserves, but so far no takers,” Harold noted.

“I thought we were here to talk about the end of such games.” Bishop stood. “Why would we make an unholy deal with these Sadducees? Shut them down, silence their lies. Let God’s truth back into the American home...”

Harold held up his hand and Bishop fell silent.

“Reverend Bishop, the Game is out of the box. More than a billion players around the world have logged into this environment. Even if we destroy this version, others will appear. We intend to hack it, buy it, steal it, if necessary, and then use it, keep it active but bend it to our purpose.”

“Take control of the Game?” Tom asked.

“You could start by letting people manage their own bio forms,” Franklin suggested. “Or rather, some people.”

“Some people?” Harold asked.

“Maybe an elite group. Hand picked, people who matter, and who naturally have certain objections.”

“Objections...to being honest?”

“To disclosure. Discretion is the handmaiden of power.”

“I see.”

“Could it teach children to be more civil? Respectful?” Arlene asked.

“Arlene, this technology can teach your cat to program your Blu-Ray player.”

“A billion players, each with a soul at risk,” Bishop mused.

“You could preach to each and every one,” Harold said, “And they can read your books in one afternoon.” Bishop’s University had printed several volumes of his sermons.

“Think of that!”

“...and the advertising revenue,” Nancy said, “and the subscription fees.”

Now everyone was talking at the same time: the very idea of a billion players, users, actual customers, putting up money every month.

“But first,” Harold said. The room fell silent. “First we pull the plug and see who plugs it back in. Captain Rankin, can your operatives isolate all of the Junana servers from the Ariadne backbone simultaneously?”

“Give me twenty-four hours and pick your time.”

“Let’s go for Noon, Pacific Time, on Thursday.”

“Can you make it Sunday?” Franklin asked. “Maybe Reverend Bishop could work something into his sermon.” Franklin looked over the table at Bishop, who smiled and nodded.

“A first rate suggestion. I’ll have ten million worshippers nationwide praying for Junana to be crushed.”

“Fine. Sunday at noon, PST,” Harold agreed.

“You want it noisy or quiet?” Rankin asked.

“I think quiet is the way to go. Nobody gets hurt.”

She nodded slowly, visibly disappointed.

“Good lord,” Harold thought, “who are these people?”
