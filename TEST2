# **Policy and Procedure 3.1 - Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) Accounting Policies and Procedures**

1.  > Basis of Accounting
    
    1.  > Policy: The organization uses the accrual basis of accounting.
        > The accrual basis is the method of accounting whereby revenue
        > and expenses are identified with specific periods of time,
        > such as a month or year, and are recorded as incurred. This
        > method of recording revenue and expenses is without regard to
        > date of receipt or payment of cash.
    
    2.  > Procedure:
        
        1.  > Throughout the fiscal year, expenses are accrued into the
            > month in which they are incurred. The books are closed no
            > later than the 15th of the month after the close of the
            > month. Invoices received after closing the books will be
            > counted as a current-month expense.
        
        2.  > At the close of the fiscal year, this rule is not
            > enforced. All expenses that should be accrued into the
            > prior fiscal year, are so accrued, in order to ensure that
            > year-end financial statements reflect all expenses
            > incurred during the fiscal year. Year-end books are closed
            > no later than 90 days after the end of the fiscal year.
        
        3.  > Revenue is always recorded in the month in which it was
            > earned or pledged.

2.  > Reconciliations
    
    3.  > Policy: All bank and credit card statements will be opened and
        > reviewed in a timely manner. Reconciliation and approval will
        > occur within 30 days of the close of the month.
    
    4.  > Procedures:
        
        4.  > Monthly statements are reviewed by the Finance Manager,
            > who then submits them to a third party bookkeeper for
            > reconciliation. The bookkeeper communicates to the Finance
            > Manager any discrepancies, and reports back the results of
            > the reconciliations.
