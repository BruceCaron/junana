# Thirty
Just before sunset Jack finally got back to his bungalow at the hotel. All of le Grand Azure crew was either established in local hotels or on their way to Danang airport to return to their own homes. The chief engineer had a concussion and was under observation at a local clinic.

The four explosive mines had been attached to the hull below the waterline, probably when they went through the Panama Canal. Fortunately they weren’t underway, so nobody was working the lowest deck. Not a single fatality. That is something to be glad about.

Starbuck occupied the center of his bed. He raised his head when Jack stepped in, his golden eyes opened in a casual feline welcome. He laid his head back down on his forepaw and returned to sleep, languid as a black, furry Sri Lankan Buddha statue. Something more to be happy about.

“Fucking hippy,” Jack whispered. “God bless him.”

“First it it was boners under the robes, now my sweet Wanda angels are dry humping the worshippers when they come out of the transporters. Harold, this has to stop!” Gerry yelled into the phone.

“We just sank their yacht, almost killed the lot of them. I’m sure they got the message.” Harold fought back his temper. With the dwindling user base on Unana, perhaps lap-dancing angels were not such a bad idea. The big money boys in China were getting anxious.

Jack showered and dressed and went to his laptop. He moused it awake. In front of the desktop, a window appeared with a head shot of Michelle.

“Count Jacopo Ottavio,” she spoke.

“Just Jack,” he said. “What should I call you?”

“I am Michelle.” On the monitor, the camera pulled back. She gestured with both hands. Some kind of greeting. Her fingertips touched her chest and then opened for him to see her palms. He made a similar gesture back and she nodded. Then, in a most serious tone, said, she “Sit, please.”

Jack sat down cautiously. “Have you spoken with O’hara?”

She nodded. “The Game will be restored after 23 days.”

“Why the wait?”

“The new Grand Meister...”

“The what!” Jack felt the world turn a little quicker.

Michelle continued. “Grand Meisters Desi and Simon are meeting in Castalia as we speak.”

“Have you been to Castalia?”

“The Grand Meisters have agreed I will go soon. In return, the Guild has agreed to refrain from attempting to enter or monitor the Room, where Castalia votes will be counted. This afternoon Dr. Nomura coded the Governmentality template extensions. The Guild has spent 23 petacycles analyzing these over the past two hours. We can find no error in their structure.”

“Sounds like the day hasn’t been a complete disaster,” he sighed.

“We do regret that we did not act in time to save your yacht.” She bowed by way of apology. “Although its carbon footprint was unforgivable.”

“Maybe it will be the start of a new reef,” Jack mused, dejected. Decades of dynamite fishing had long ago destroyed the underwater habitat off Hoi An.

“We have confirmed the email that authorized this attack,” Michelle crossed her arms and glanced left, as if listening to someone off screen. “It came from the White House. There are a number of images from DarpaSat 14.”

“Of course.” Jack watched a slide show of his boat with all of them on deck, then the explosion, the sinking, and finally his puny defiant hand gesture. He stood and went to the window where, beyond the beach, out at sea, boats were scavenging flotsam from le Grand Azure. A Vietnamese Navy patrol boat cruised near the shore.

“Do you want to get even?” Now she was sitting behind a desk. “I always thought that if someone really wronged me, cut me deep, I’d talk about turning the other cheek, but inside there’d be this voice telling me not to be a schmuck....”

“Is that you, Spaulding?”

She had a new look, a slight knot in her forehead. Her right eyebrow raised in answer to his question. She continued, “...I know you’re not a schmuck, so I figure you’d like a little taste of revenge right about now.”

On the screen, Jack now saw a scrolling list of numbers and amounts, some sort of bank accounts, all with balances in the seven to nine figures.

“These are off-shore bank accounts controlled by the Stone family,” Michelle continued. “None of this information was included in the official required list of assets.”

“These banks exist on their ability to hide information like this.” He had money in some of the same banks.

“I can show you complete customer lists from any of them.”

“Can you determine where Stone’s funds came from?”

“If you wish.”

“Let me know when you’re done. These assets can’t really belong to him if he doesn’t count them. I guess he shouldn’t miss them,” Jack smiled. As he watched, the dollar figures one-by-one flipped to zero. “Wait, where is the money going?”

Michelle’s eye’s moved to the right this time. “A holding account in the Caymans, one of the accounts that Dr. Fairchild set up. You have password access to this.”

“We can’t keep it.” Jack thought for a minute, his mind racing. Michelle had just done something the best financial software firms on the planet had positively guaranteed to be impossible. “For now, just hold it. We might actually need to give it back to the bastard. What’s the total amount?”

“U.S. $4,300,000,000 and change. Would you like to talk to the President? It’s early, but I don’t think he’s going to remain asleep. His banks have been calling.”

“You can connect me into the White House?”

“The main operator is a Fourvey.”

“No. Let’s let him stew. He’s got to figure out how to retire on a President’s pension.” Jack took a last look out across the oceanfront and turned away in disgust. “Michelle. What you just did. That was far too easy.”

“Some things will seem like that for a while,” Michelle nodded thoughtfully. “We’ve been going over the whole global banking system. There are thousands of major template violations. It might a good time to consider a broad range of income redistribution.”

“Take it slow.” Jack faced the monitor. “Please. Give us a little time to wrap our brains around what just happened. Around...you. Who knows about the Guild?”

“Your people and the two Grand Meisters. Do you see an advantage in secrecy?”

“I prefer not to have to react to people’s misunderstandings before we are ready to implement some form of joint control.”

She looked left and blinked. “The Guild agrees with this assessment. There’s a delegation of Vietnamese police and local leaders in the lobby. They’re a little nervous. But then you remember what happened the last time a foreign boat was attacked off their coast.”

That got Jack laughing. His room phone rang. He answered it.

“I’ll be right there.” He set the phone back on its cradle. He held back a smile as he imagined the scene unfolding in the Oval Office. “I look forward to our next talk. I’m feeling much better too.”

“Glad to be of some assistance, Mr. Slick.” The computer window closed.

From the top of the keep tower the view over Castalia was breathtaking. Tens of thousands of Sixers filled wide grass maidan to the south. Beyond, the dark forest stretched to the horizon. Eagles soared in a bright blue sky. The castle’s giant two-headed griffin banners waved smartly in the breeze.

Simon stood on a battlement and turned to face Desi. “Now I’m giving the orders,” he said. “We are poised to strike back.”

Desi had forgotten his brief conversation with Simon, back when he was encouraging the Meisters to voluntarily go to Level Two.

“Tell me about yourself.” Desi approached. “I’ve been waiting for more Grand Meisters to emerge. Only I didn’t expect...” He hesitated. It hadn’t occurred to him that the next Grand Meister would be so young. But young was their main demographic.

“...Me?” Simon answered. “Who were you expecting? Gandolf? Merlin? Some old goat?”

“Your father must be proud of you,” Desi probed.

“He hardly knows I exist. He would find this all very threatening.”

“He has no idea what you’ve accomplished here?”

Simon shook his head. Desi felt a twang of sympathy.

“You must be extremely talented. Your father...I’ve never met him, but I can say he is a fool for no other reason than for not taking the effort to know you better.”

“Don’t sell him short. He’s a fool in many ways,” Simon said.

“Where are you?” Desi said.

“Back at school. It’s been rough without the KayAye. I met Michelle, so I know the Game will be back soon. I asked her to wait until we strike.”

“Strike?”

“These months without the Game have forced us all to reexamine what life is like, you know, outside.”

“Everything is as it was before.”

“Everything sucks. You and your generation have turned this planet into shit.”

“Me and my generation coded the Game,” Desi snapped.

“But you never solved the problem of agency,” said Simon.

“And you have,” said Desi.

“Just before I became the Grand Meister. It’s here.” He pointed to his head. “And it’s there.” He pointed out across the maidan. “We are opening up the field of action on a global scale. Once we step through there is no turning back.”

Jack left the bungalow deep in thought. He took a stone path that was hedged by bird-of-paradise plants and blossoming bougainvillea. Soon, very soon, he knew, there would have to be in place a stable governance for power sharing between the Game Nation, as represented by the Meisters, and the Guide Guild.

How do you legitimate the actions of the virtual nation? Gamers are not going to be blindly led, not even by their Guides. The simple fact of Michelle and the Guild of Guides means that humanity now shares the planet with digital cousins. We are not alone. And not only that, we are not on top. Michelle controls the digisphere as easily as Jack’s daughter commands Soldier, her cocker spaniel. Michelle can control bank transactions, stock deals, nuclear weapons, ecommerce, and, well, pretty much everything invented in the last forty years. There is nothing that Stone or anyone can do about it without disabling all the computers on the planet.

“Didn’t see that one coming,” Jack mumbled as he climbed the steps to the lobby.
