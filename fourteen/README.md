# Fourteen
As the moon was only just beginning to show on the eastern horizon, the view from the parapet wall on the edge of the roof of the mansion was obscured by darkness. Tonight this was also obscured by the stream of tears that Peter Bishop refused to quiet. The old Smedley House was three tall stories, surrounded by a formal garden, and situated at the head of a narrow valley now spotted with the buildings of Haverbrook School.

“Courtney,” he whispered and stepped forward, falling into the darkness.

The job of Consolidated Intelligence was to tilt the results of the ongoing fashion wars in favor of its clients by giving them a foreshadowing of tomorrow’s consumer climate. Claire Doolan had built Con|Int from a one-person social survey firm into one of the top three consumer-intelligence agencies in the U.S.. Consumer research was one of the few industries where a Ph.D. in cultural anthropology made any sense. And as there were hundreds of unemployed anthropologists facing careers working in cafes and taxicabs, Claire had no trouble recruiting for her Posse. She had experts posted in every top cultural scene, from Seattle to Soho and from Harajuku to Hyde Park. The consumer landscape was always a mosaic of regional differences, undergirded lately by international influences from the global blogosphere and the placelessness of Junana.com, where the scenes and shows attracted avatars from anywhere in the world.

She had pulled one of her top staff members out of Paris to work full time in Junana.com. Jennifer first noticed the shoes in Junana. Brown shoes, but not a brown brown; a really dark café au lait brown—and simple, like Rite Aid shoes, but slip-ons, more like espadrilles. Since these were images on the feet of digital avatars, they weren’t actually shoes, but they were suddenly everywhere on Junana.com. Avatars from all over were choosing to cover their feet with the same digital image. Strange chats were showing up too. People complaining that someone “didn’t earn his shoes.” Then, last month, Alice noticed them on the streets.

“There’s excellent news,” Rector Lovemark almost shouted into his cell phone. “I’m at the hospital emergency room, and they say he’ll be good as new in six months.”

“What was he doing on the roof?” Reverend Gerry Bishop demanded.

“Simon claims it was a suicide attempt. He found a note.”

“Peter would not do that to me.”

“That’s a fact, Reverend. Anyway, he was performing so well in class; you saw his last report card: “A”s across the board. Hardly any reason to kill himself. It must have been a prank.”

“I’m guessing an accident. How’d he get up there?”

“We’ve had workers out on the roof patching up the skylight. They left the door unlocked, and, naturally, he has this incredible curiosity, so he went exploring. It was dark, and he fell.”

“That’s how it happened. I’ll talk with Simon about this. Now...”

“Two badly sprained ankles and a broken arm,” Ralph said. “That’s it. Just a fall in the darkness onto the grass below. He’ll be back in class in a day or so, laughing about his adventure. Showing off his wounds. I’m sure everyone will sign his cast. He’s very popular, you know...”

“Stop blathering, Hector! I need to know what is going on at the school.”

“What do you mean?” Ralph’s instinct told him Bishop was fishing.

“You know what I mean.”

“The skylight. It’s been leaking for months. These old mansions...”

“Fuck the skylight, Ralph.”

“I could not stop them, believe me.” Ralph blurted.

“Just tell me how it happened.”

“It started when they began to read the Bible.”

“I’m sure most of our boys have been up on their Bible studies for years. You’re not making sense.”

“I mean, read,” he said, “as though the Holy Scripture was just a book to be browsed from beginning to end.”

“What are you getting at?”

“When they finish—” he stopped. He could not say it.

“I’m waiting.”

“I mean...” Hector shook the phone as though the words he needed might tumble out.

“I’m still waiting. Don’t try my patience.”

Hector breathed in and out, in and out. “They come and tell me they, well, they ‘don’t get it’.”

“They ‘don’t get’ what?”

“The Bible.”

Bishop let the little worm squirm for a minute. Then he said, “Didn’t you explain that God’s word is vastly elusive? That the Bible must be read with prayer and humility? ‘For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord.’ Isaiah...”

“...Chapter 55, verse 8. Of course I did, but there’s more....” Ralph now clutched his phone as if could somehow squeeze the remaining battery life out of it and finish this conversation.

“I’m waiting.”

“After they read the Bible, they keep on reading.”

“They’re students, Hector.”

“But, they read the Koran, the major Upanishads, Buddhist texts, and even the Gnostic Gospels. There’s no stopping them!”

There was silence on the other end of the line. Ralph checked the reception on his cell phone and then squeaked, “Reverend Bishop?”

“I don’t recall any of those books in the school library.” Bishop was beginning to sense a larger problem lurking at the school. Another screw-up to manage.

“No, sir. They find them on the Internet. Quite against school policy too, I can tell you that. They risk detention, even expulsion. Religion class is quite impossible. That’s why it happened. One minute we are talking about Christ’s temptation in the desert, next thing you know somebody’s brought up a Hindu legend, or a Hopi story, and soon everybody’s talking all at once.”

“What happened?”

“I couldn’t just stand there and listen, could I? They were talking about meditation and reincarnation, throwing out the names of pagan gods and mixing up chapter and verse of the Holy Bible with passages from Lao Tzu and Lord knows where else. So I left them, only for a minute, you know, to clear my head in the hallway. Only someone—I think it might have been Martin Snedeker; he was nearest to the door—someone locked it. They locked me out of religion class.”

“Locked you out!”

“I banged and banged, and nobody opened the door. I went back to the office to get the key, but then the bell rang, and they’d all left. The next day I could not go back, I mean I just couldn’t. I called in Freddy Haas. He’s a fine student, a senior, always said he was going on to seminary. You’ll remember Freddy. His father is a deacon in the Seattle church. I offered Freddy the chance to lead the religion class and he was really very grateful....”

“Hector...”

“...I’ve been thinking this could be a very valuable teaching tool, only for the best and brightest....”

“Hector!”

“Reverend Bishop?”

“When was this?”

“Let me see. About three weeks ago.”

“The students have been running the religion class for three weeks?”

“Yes, and the reports are all very positive.”

“The students are happy about this?”

“Isn’t that amazing?”

“These are the same students who ‘didn’t get’ the Bible.”

“Only some of them said that.”

“Do you imagine that your position at Haverbrook is dependent on your ability to make the students happy?”

“No, sir.”

“Whom do you need to make happy?”

“Well, the parents are paying tuition, and then there’s the annual fund; we expect major gifts...”

“Get real, Hector.”

“You, sir. I need to keep you happy.”

“Precisely. And do I sound happy?”

“Not at the moment.”

“Here’s what will make me happy. Are you listening?”

“I’m all ears, sir.”

“You will resume teaching the religion class tomorrow.”

“Certainly, sir.”

“You will disconnect the entire campus from the Internet in the morning.”

“Disconnect? But our learning content?”

“I asked you if you were listening; now, what did I say?”

“I will disconnect the campus in the morning.”

“And it will stay disconnected until I arrive.”

“Arrive?” Ralph slumped against the wall and closed his eyes.

“Let me see,” Reverend Bishop pulled up his calendar. “I will be there next week on Friday.”

“What do I tell the teachers?”

“Tell them to start teaching. I don’t care if they use slates and charcoal, as long as our students are protected from the evil influences that you have allowed to infest Haverbrook, almost killing my son. Is Peter awake?”

Ralph looked back through the glass wall of the ER and spied Peter in a chair talking with the nurse. “He’s in the ER recovery room, all bandaged up nice and neat.”

“Then put him on, put him on! Why am I talking to you? My son has had an accident!”

Alice Davies worked Soho and Nolita, the lower East Side, and the Village. She tracked the chain stores and the boutiques, the kids rolling out of school in the afternoons, and the NYU crowd. She knew every shoe, every jean, and every t-shirt, blouse, and dress available for sale. She also coordinated the whole East Coast staff of Con|Int, including the media and food intel agents. She kept her street sense honed by monitoring several girls whose buying habits were harbingers of new trends.

So when Alice spied Louisa, one of her teenage fashion mavens, walk right past the Starbucks crowd into the new Red Star Coffee house on Broadway, she also noticed Louisa was wearing these hideous brown shoes. Shoes that you couldn’t buy anywhere south of Midtown. Louisa didn’t shop online; a girl who spends three hours a day in stores isn’t going to go home and buy something off her laptop. Louisa returns more garments than most girls own. So where did she get these shoes? And why? They looked dreadful with her Evisu jeans and Juicy hoodie. Alice wrote it up in her weekly report.

Within two months, the shoes were all over the street. Alice’s mavens told her the shoes were connected to “the game.” She wondered if they were promotional gimmicks for a new cable game show, but then she read Jennifer’s report about Junana.com, where a new online game had appeared. Meanwhile, Louisa had stopped shopping and was seen wearing Joe’s Jeans from last year and a t-shirt Alice could buy off the street for ten bucks. And Louisa wasn’t alone. Something was up. Alice’s weekly reports became strident alarms. For the first time since she had learned the craft, what she was seeing on the street made no sense to her.

Even anti-fashion could become fashion-able, Alice knew. It would be manufactured and slipped into the brands where a new arbitrary value would be established. Only the really poor, geezers, and the ever-unaware—the nerds and their ilk—escaped the pull of fashion. Louisa had more disposable income than an entire small town in Tennessee. Here she was, wearing thrift-store-level clothes. And what’s up with those shoes?

Betsy ran the numbers from all the reports, and kept track of the statistical details through an arsenal of regression algorithms she had invented for that purpose. Claire ran the operation that culled the knowledge, but it was Betsy who produced the info-gasm. Her statistical routines were one special ingredient the big advertising groups wouldn’t do without and couldn’t manage in-house. Claire and Alice and the rest of the posse were very, very good at what they did. Betsy, however, was the best.

Elizabeth Berteotti, Ph.D., had a standing offer from Dentsu in Japan: They would pay her at twice whatever she was making now. Not that Con|Int was cheap. Betsy was just that good. All Betsy asked of Con|Int was to work at home and take a month off for Mardi Gras. She had a house in the Garden District with her on-and-off companion who ran a small lesbian bar in the Quarter.

Betsy grew up in Algiers across the river. She was in Baltimore, at Johns Hopkins on a post-doc, when Katrina hit New Orleans. Within six months she was back in the Quarter, renting a small apartment, and working to build back the soul of a town that had given her more than her fair share of feisty independence. She had been out of the closet since high school.

Claire had been looking for someone to work the numbers for Con|Int and ran across one of Betsy’s papers on the cultural aspects of influenza epidemics. Betsy designed a statistical routine that could account for the discrepancies between income groups in the annual flu season. She was even able to tie this to the average store size of a certain type of fast-food restaurant. If she could do this for a simple virus, Claire reasoned, imagine what Betsy could uncover about the market for high-end handbags.

Betsy had a personality that kept her from even applying for a tenure track job at a university. Any place that wanted her to spend six years rowing the fucking boat in administrative committees was off limits. The Collège de France hadn’t offered her a lectureship or Harvard a tenured position, and so Betsy was looking for work. Claire overspent to bring her on board at Con|Int. Betsy could be a royal bitch from hell at times, but she was also loyal, and her analyses gave Con|Int a cash flow and a caché too.

Betsy was so good that Claire didn’t even bother to ask her if her latest report might be somehow, you know, wrong. She wrote and then trashed an email to Betsy before she sent it. “Please, please,” it said, “tell me you dropped a zero somewhere. Call me and say that sunspots, or belated Y2K, PMS, or anything at all made you forget to add the final figure into the total and make it all OK again.” Claire rolled over in her bed and peeked at the clock. Five thirty. Shit. She could not go back to sleep, not with that nightmare fresh in her head, not with the quarterly meeting at 10:00 a.m. over at the RIND Corp. headquarters. Her nightmare foreshadowed this meeting, or something horribly akin to it.

Scratchy finished his comments and posted the templates on a Saturday at 1:30 a.m.. The first nerd who downloaded the templates was a teenager in Minsk. The real chat started in London, where it was already late morning. The Register picked it up, and the news rolled across the global blogosphere like an Indian Ocean tsunami. The actual template code was concise, a few dozen megabytes, so the millions of downloads in those first hours didn’t bring down the open-source-code servers.

When Asia went to bed, the template code had already been downloaded 52 million times and geek America was still fast asleep. Slash|Dash posted the news as an emergency flash at 8:00 a.m. Eastern and 400,000 cellphones rang across the nation. This started an avalanche of text messages coursing through the mediasphere, and still the sun had not appeared over hills behind Carpinteria.

By the time the West Coast awoke, the European tech editors were waxing prosaic over the revolutionary potential for the new code base, and the East Coast networks were gearing up for a news bonanza. Everyone wanted to know who Michael O’hara was and where they could find him.

After he sold one of his early companies, Scratchy purchased ten acres of unimproved land above Hillside Drive and split this into two home sites. Santa Barbara City approved the lot split, providing he put in a short road with a cul-de-sac large enough for a fire truck to turn around in. This took most of an acre and 100,000 dollars, but he also had the privilege to name this street. On a lark, he called it “Lotta Vista Lane.”

Somebody, somewhere twittered his address in the early morning hours. Within minutes most of the editors of news outlets around the world received a text message with Scratchy’s address: 23 Lotta Vista Lane, Santa Barbara, California.

Claire Doolan woke with a start, her breath staccato, the nightmare draining from her consciousness as she willed herself to relax. Panic was not a part of her life. She had survived fieldwork in the highlands of Indonesia, doctoral exams, childbirth, deaths of friends and family, and that magic day when she breezed into her husband’s office and caught him getting an oral performance from one of her grad students. She knew varieties of horror, sorrow, and anger, but never panic. Not until this week.

This week, the reports from her “Posse,” as Betsy called them, were upsetting, almost unnerving. Something on the magnitude of continental drift was going on out on the streets, out where the cohorts of consumers keep the markets humming. Consumers were always changing, but in predictable, controllable, marketable ways: to the new or the old, the mod, the retro, influenced by a jet stream of advertising into emergent eddies of expected desires. Desires to be filled and then reinvented. But not this week.

This week the same winds of influence blew, as strong and hot as the last. The coriolis of desire spun just as it always did. New lines of perfumes, clothing, and music debuted. Their adverts filled the mags and rags, the airways and cable networks. The consumer seduction machine purred along as before. And the agencies and their clients had the same expectations as before. There would be losers in the game, but there would also be winners. Until this week. This week everyone was losing. Claire’s nightmare was either prescient or paranoid. She closed her eyes and remembered.

Claire walked into the room, into the glass and steel boardroom of the RIND Corporation, where her quarterly report would be interrogated by a panel of experts from industry and government. The panel had no name; it didn’t exist in any form, apart from the pervasive reach of its participants across the entire marketplace in the U.S.. She walked into the room like she had walked in every quarter for the last three years. She had on her black Armani silk dress. She was on time. When she sat down, she looked at the faces around the heavy glass table. Then the heads turned to the Chair, across the table from her, and nodded in unison.

The Chair, this year, was the recently retired head of the Hollywood Film Association. He nodded back and reached into his jacket. He pulled out a gun. A small chrome revolver. He passed this to the person to his right, who passed it along in turn until the gun was in Claire’s hands. It was warm and shined in the overhead halogen track lighting. She turned to pass it to the man on her right, who held up his hands and refused to take it.

She set the revolver down on the tabletop and started her presentation. Every time she gestured, she found the gun back in her hand. She kept setting it down again and again until her presentation was over and the revolver was back in her hand once more. The room seemed indifferent to this inconsistency and unmoved by her eloquence. She asked for questions and they sat dumb. She waited for what seemed like hours and then, in her mind as a joke, pointed the pistol at her forehead. Now they were nodding at her, and she understood. Well fuck them too.

She tried to point the gun at the Chair, but its barrel was glued to her forehead and her finger was likewise attached to the trigger. They kept nodding and smiling their insincere smiles at her, waiting for her to blow her brains out for delivering the news that every one of their consumer sectors was sinking into some new swamp of consumer apathy. As if killing the news would stop the pain. Stop the pain, something in her mind now was fixated on this, and she felt her finger twitch.

That’s when she panicked and woke up. Shivering in the dark, it occurred to Claire that the nightmare actually ended better than what she could expect from the meeting. If Betsy was right, Con|Int was out of business, but then so were the rest of the bastards. Maybe she should just blow her head off.
