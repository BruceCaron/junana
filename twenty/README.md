All day long Essie could not leave the store. She had half an hour for lunch and two five-minute breaks for comfort. The owner was very strict with her time now, and did not want her playing on her Computo while she worked. Mornings were sometimes slow, and she knew when he was off fishing because the boat made such a noise. So Essie and Annaline managed a bit of Game time each day while she tended to the store.

With her hat she had received the diploma paper. “Bachelor of Knowledge,” it said in big golden letters. She looked up ‘bachelor’ and figured they had sent this to her by mistake. “Spinster of Sorrow,” that would be her diploma. Nobody would marry her, nobody she would marry.

Men came by the cuca shop and spoke to her about beer and dancing at that joint on the road. They came only because she ran the store and they figured she could steal for them or turn her back as they loaded up. Nangoloh sold stolen canned goods in the village. The men figured a plain girl like her would be easy to sweet talk out of the same goods.

“Earn your shoes,” she told them. “Then come talk to me.”

“Woman you make no sense,” they told her. She paid them little attention, but she put a lock on the inside of the door to her lean-to. Let them rattle the door at night, she was busy on Level Four.

“Sincerity is a gift, not a given.”

Dickey Gronberg frowned at the latest consumer survey commissioned by his section of the Department of Commerce. Out of a sample of 3,000 adults, more than 40 percent of the surveys completely failed the internal consistency tests; another 30 percent barely passed them. This meant that more than half of the survey respondents were either lying or joking with their answers. Dozens had included this little phrase in their comments.

“Sincerity is a gift, not a given.” What the hell is that supposed to mean? What about “responsibility?”

Dickey sifted through the reports coming in from the retailers, the wholesalers, the shippers and the foreign factories. Without the incessant pull from the American consumer, the entire supply chain had clogged tighter than a college dorm toilet on homecoming night. Retailers cancelled their orders and marked down their stock. Wholesalers stopped the trucks from off-loading to their bulging warehouses. Shippers halted the loading of the containers in the ports. Factories cancelled shifts and delayed piecework contracts.

Millions of computers, TVs, lawnmowers, and espresso makers sat in their boxes strung along the global supply chain. Shipping containers, stuffed to their ceilings, were stacked up like Lego bricks in ports around the world’s oceans. Advance orders were put on hold while the retailers continued to lower their prices. The ripple effects would extend into the coming years even if there were a near-term rebound.

Dickey was equally concerned about the recent ugly tone of the emails within the Department. The grim news from the stock market, where both the retail and the manufacturing sectors were taking huge hits, put the President in a funk. Stone was leaning on Commerce to come up with some good news.

Dickey was on the spot. How could he predict the future when half the people in the nation suddenly feel like lying to a government survey? Unpredictability was, for Dickey, a substantially greater problem than the actual direction of the economy. Nobody expected his unit to control the trends, but everyone seemed to think he should predict them. And they were all waiting for him to reveal when the upturn would begin.

“Sincerity is a gift, not a given.” He searched this and found out it came from Junana, from that Game everyone was talking about. The Department had a policy against any of its thirty thousand employees logging into Junana at their jobs. An email from the Secretary went to all employees just last month, threatening termination of any employee who used Junana from a Department computer.

Somehow, the Junana client had been downloaded onto the central application server, and then distributed to every computer in the network. Attempts to purge this application had failed. It seemed immune to any attempt to uninstall it. The IT division had concluded they would need to wipe all the disks and the ROM from every computer on the network, which would shut down the entire Department for weeks. So Dickey, like every other employee, could pull up the Junana client on his computer.

The other issue with Junana was that it used a protocol that ran through the Department’s firewalls with neither a trace nor any apparent effect. This meant that, unless you actually snuck up on an employee and saw them using Junana, they could play this all day and nobody would be the wiser.

Dickey had joined up with Junana a year before, but had found very little time to spend there. He did reestablish contact with several of his University of Chicago classmates and he found a group that shared his interest in mycology. Dickey loved hunting chanterelles in the late fall; it felt like plucking manna from the fields.

Itchy had scheduled a Room meeting to show off the new Castalia design. The Room had been moved to the castle keep and situated in its basement dungeon. A circular stone staircase on its outer wall led down from the main floor. Against the other walls, skeletons still dangled from manacles,  and their jaws moved in some final agony. The Console was now a 3D cube in the middle of the room, with four access keyboards. Itchy was at the one of the keyboards when Desi popped in.

“Now this is Retro!” he said, drifting around the room. One of the skeletons attracted him, and so he moved close. “Olivia Newton-John?” He walked to the next skeleton. “Culture Club?” And the next. “Cyndi Lauper?”

“Why, they’re all whispering '80s pop tunes.”

“It’s called torture.” Scratchy was standing next to the curving stone wall. “Nice sconces!”

The walls had a number of brass fixtures with lit torches that flickered and smoked in an exquisitely real fashion.

Jack popped in. “I’m going to miss the London Club motif, but this is...cosy. I like the audio.” The room reverberated like a giant cave.

“Very nice.” Winston popped in and said. “What? No Cordobaloungers!”

Scratchy shook hands with one of the skeletons. “If our avatars get tired of standing they can go dangle on the wall.”

“Scratchy, I’ve got news for you.” Winston walked up behind Scratchy. “Reed wants you to be their commencement speaker this year instead of moi.”

“Winston, that’s just not...” Desi said, turning around. “Winston, why are you invisible?”

“Invisible?” Winston toggled 3rd Person and looked back at himself. “There’s a bug for you. I’m invisible.”

“That’s not a bug,” Scratchy strode over to the console. “We’ve been hacked!”

“How? When?” Desi took one his place at one of the free keyboards. “Call up the Room database,” he said.

“I’m there,” Scratchy said. “I see only the five of us logged in.”

“Keep that window open,” Desi said. “Winston, when were you last in the Room?”

“Weeks ago.”

Itchy scrolled through a log list. “According to this, you were here last week. Desi and I were here, too, and I don’t remember talking to you.”

“That’s because it wasn’t me.”

“You logged in.”

“Somebody phished your password,” Scratchy said. “Did you reset your Junana password recently?”

“I got a message from Junana, like everyone else,” Winston said.

“We all got the message,” Scratchy said. “And it was from Junana. So it’s an inside job.”

“Top level,” Desi added.

“What’s going on?” Jack asked.

“I fucked up,” Scratchy said. “I kept the Game admin on the same sign-in as Junana. I should have split these apart in the beginning. One of our employees has chosen to steal our code. I would guess they have the whole dump from our IDE, since they logged in as Winston. They turned him invisible so they could get into the Room and not be seen in case others were here.”

“They have all the code?” Jack asked.

“That’s what we have to assume. Reset all the admin level passwords!” Scratchy said.

“Nobody will be able to log in,” Itchy said.

Scratchy nodded. “Set all our passwords to ‘swordfish’ temporarily.”

“Log out anybody with Root access who is logged in. We are all going to be logged out. Everybody log back in using the temporary password ‘swordfish.’ Got it?” The avatars all nodded.

“See you in a minute,” Itchy said. The room faded to white.

One by one they logged back in. The Nerds took up positions at the consoles.

“We are now the only ones with Root access on the system.” Desi confirmed.

“Who did this?” Winston asked.

“Either the inside guy was working alone, or he was paid to do this. Either way, once the code is out, it will migrate up the money chain to the top. Somebody will make a killing on this. Somebody we really do not want to have our code, I imagine.”

“What’s the plan?”

 “We already kicked them off the system and reset the passwords. Now we get this goddamn console out of Junana, set up a whole new security system for the Game administration, and then give it, maybe a year, probably a lot less, before they hack the Game from the outside.” Scratchy was not optimistic.

“They know too much about our code,” Itchy added.

“It just depends how much cash they have to throw at the problem,” Desi concluded.

“How long before we can track down the thief?” Jack asked.

“It won’t take long. I imagine we’ve spooked him by resetting his passwords. Whoever doesn’t show up for work tomorrow is probably our Judas,” Itchy said. “Anyhow, we can mine the logs and ferret them out. And if they rig the logs, we can find that too. Just a matter of time.”

“We’ve got a lot of programming to do before tomorrow. First thing is to pull all the Game admin code out of Junana, make this Room accessible only from an external, secure sign in,” Scratchy said and looked around him. “Somebody make Winston visible, will you?”

Winston popped into view. He was wearing the Hat.

“Ricky! You’ve got your Hat!” Desi said. “I’m so proud of you.”

“That’s better,” Scratchy said. “I wanted to tell this to your face. First off. You did no wrong. It wasn’t you who fucked up. You just reset your password like a good user. Second. I will tell Reed that I will do a commencement talk, but only if the President apologizes directly to you, insists that you do the talk next year, and eats one of those nasty giant roaches at RennFayre.”

Winston put a big grin on his avatar’s face.

“Mickey’s got principles,” Desi said. “People forget because of his bad fashion sense.”

“We can defeat who did this,” Jack said. His avatar gestured confidently.

“How do you figure,” Scratchy said.

“Release the code,” Jack said.

They stopped typing and looked at each other. Scratchy’s avatar cracked its wry grin.

“Brilliant!” Itchy said.

“We find out the version they stole, make it public...” Desi added.

“...and worthless,” Winston added.

“...only by then we’ll have rewritten and implemented all new security code,” Desi said.

“Busy, busy, busy,” Scratchy said. The three of them started typing again.

“What would have happened if the thief had remembered to make Winston visible again?” Jack asked.

“They would build their own administrative back end and one day very soon we would not have been able to log in,” Itchy said.

“A cyber coup d’etat,” Desi added. “Mikey, I’ll find out what version was taken. You work on the new admin security. Itchy, we’ll need a Room outside of Junana, a cloned environment from the ground up. Might as well take all of Castalia out as well, and then make the Room exterior to that.”

“Got it,” Itchy said.

“Count Slick,” Winston said. “Have you seen the rest of Castalia? It’s a nice little kingdom.” They started climbing the stairs.

“We almost lost it,” Jack said.

“That we did,” Winston said.

Dickey glanced over his desk through the doorway to his secretary’s office. He could faintly hear her typing on her computer. He moused to the Junana client and opened the program. Then he logged in and found himself in some kind of Roman antechamber, with two doors, one on each end. One door was marked “Junana” and the other “Game.”

He glanced again at his office’s open doorway. He was only going to research this Game for a few minutes. He sent his avatar to the door marked “Game” and knocked.

The scene faded and a new scene appeared. His avatar was reclining on a king sized bed in what might be a mansion or a high-priced hotel suite. The decor was pure Deco. The walls were cream, the lamps, moderne, the scale was simply huge. Double French doors opened to another room, and Dickey sent his avatar through these. This room was also expansive, with a fireplace on one wall, a selection of abstract impressionist paintings on another, and a brace of large windows and another set of French doors on the third, where warm sunlight was filtering into the room. These doors were open and a breeze fluttered the floor length curtains that framed the two windows.

Dickey sent his avatar toward the open doors. Outside stood a terrazzo patio and a balustrade of marble, and another avatar, male, leaning on the balustrade, looking out across the cityscape. Italian Riviera, Dickey concluded. Could be Portofino. Speedboats and fishing craft were tied up below in an azure bay. The other avatar wore white linen slacks that fell over cream-colored loafers. He had a shock of dark brown hair combed back. How retro, Dickey thought. The fellow’s physique was slender; his naked back showed nothing of the free-weight bulkiness that a gym produces. Dickey’s avatar stood in the doorway. Dickey toggled up chat and typed, “Hello.”

The other avatar turned his head and nodded. “Hi Dickey, come over here,” the chat response read. Something about the avatar’s face disturbed Dickey. It was an unforgettable face, even at a glance. Then he realized it had elements of Montgomery Clift, one of Dickey’s favorite old Hollywood movie stars. Dickey sent his avatar to the balustrade and toggled Third Person so he could see them both. He moved the POV to the front and noticed that the other avatar continued to make eye contact with him, not with his avatar. The chat window activated.

“Hi Dickey, I’m your Guide. I’ve been waiting for you for over a year. Glad to finally meet you. My name is Geoff.”

“I don’t have time to play the Game here,” Dickey typed. “I can come back later.”

“Your secretary is playing the Game, Dickey. The receptionist too. So relax.”

Dickey paused to get his thoughts around this information. The Game knew who he was, of course, since he logged in. But the Game also knew where he was, and whom he worked with, and what they were doing. A chill ran up his arms. He was instantly frightened and excited.

“I could fire them,” he typed.

“You would have to fire yourself too. Anyhow, you are not the vindictive type. Besides, they know you are playing the Game.”

“How?” he typed.

“I told their Guides when you said ‘Hello.’ Beverly is already working on Level Three. She can answer a lot questions for you, or you can always ask me anything.”

Just then, Dickey’s secretary, Beverly, came to the door. “Let me close this for you,” she said. “It’s better if you turn on the audio. I’ll make sure nobody comes in. Sally will hold your calls. Level One...” She sighed and nodded knowingly. “You are going to have such a good time!” The door closed behind her.

Dickey didn’t need to toggle the audio. It came on by itself. His office was suffused with the sounds of a port town. Lanyards clicked on the masts of a dozen yachts. Motors sputtered and whined in the distance. Seagulls cried. The resolution and the details were astounding. It was as if his computer was an open window to this actual place. Dickey toggled back to first person and looked around through his avatar’s eyes.

“Wow!” he whispered.

“Wow, indeed,” Geoff spoke, and he really spoke, his face and his mouth said the words. “Let’s go back inside where we can talk.” He put his hand on Dickey’s avatar’s shoulder and looked directly into his eyes. “We are going to be such good friends.”

Dickey dropped the mouse, suddenly confused. The Game knew he was gay. He sat stunned. He had been so deep in the closet for so long. How was it possible?

“Dickey, it’s OK.”

“How?”

“Your secrets are sacred here. It’s important that you feel safe in the Game. But it’s equally important that you and I get to understand each other.”

“Does Beverly know?”

“Dickey, you are an African-American single professional in his early forties who vacations in the Mediterranean every year. You have an apartment just east of Dupont Circle. You dress immaculately, go to the gym three times a week, and you hunt mushrooms as a hobby. Dickey, you own a Chagall. Maybe your mother doesn’t want to suspect, but probably everyone else you’ve met in the last ten years does. You are not a political appointee, so your job is not on the line. The point is, who really cares?” Geoff took his avatar’s hand. “Now come on inside, big boy. We have so very much to talk about.”

Don Driscoll was running a chron job when he was suddenly kicked out of the system. He tried to log in and his password was rejected. He tried once more, with due deliberation. No use. He listened. No sirens approaching, no commotion in the hallway. He went to the door and looked both ways down the narrow hall. Returning to his desk, he gathered up his mug, the photo of his kids, a few paper items, and some things from the shelves. He shoved everything into his courier bag, removed the key from his key ring and dropped it on the desk. Don left his office and the building without a word, and drove to his Goleta bank, where he withdrew all his funds and closed the account. He drove to his apartment to collect his clothes and took the freeway south towards LA. Tomorrow he would be talking with the person who answered his advertisement on Craigslist, the one who wanted to build an alternative Game. They had exchanged emails in which he hinted he had source code to offer for the right price. The very right price, he had added, for a very special package.

Megan wiped the milk film from the steam tube again and gave it a blast to clear the nozzle. All of the tasks of a Red Star barista had a single purpose: deliver a quality beverage. The coffee was shade-grown and fair trade, roasted in small batches locally and dated to be discarded within a week. The milk and soy products were organic. The grind was precise. The trick, however, was in the tamp.

Intern baristas toiled under a lead barista for days perfecting their tamp. Megan was a quick student and eager to prove her stuff. The crema on the double shot, the star she drew on the lattes, the fresh whipped cream for the con panna, the kiss of foam on the macchiato were the trademarks of every Red Star Coffee house on the planet. Certain motions and noises were the ballet at the center of the maelstrom of customers jamming for their caffeine: the sounds of the grinder, the steamer, the thump of the coffee paddle when she discarded the previous load, even the wipe of her hand to clear the rim of any grounds.

Everywhere she looked, Megan noticed templates. Window seats and zinc countertops, tile floors and high ceilings. The room was a design template zoo. Even the interactions with the customers followed the Attention While Interacting template. Afternoons slowed as the tables filled with Gamers, drawn by the free WiFi and the perfect cappuccinos. Most were in the latest fashion: branded goods that could now be picked up at discount stores and then altered by adding colors or layers. Three-hundred dollar jeans sold for twenty-five. Thrift stores offered them for five. No wonder her mom’s business was in the shitter.

The GameTown had recently opened up a dozen ethnic food kiosks and a maze of small shops. Free-trade goods and locally produced household items attracted Gamers from across Westwood and Santa Monica. Jack’s experiences in old-town Hanoi informed the Gametown’s Retail Gradient template. In Hanoi’s old town the retail streets were laced with informal cafes and individual vendors, creating a market density that spawned its own daily spectacle. The Restaurant Every Meal template provided for Gametown residents to take all their meals in the street-level restaurants for a cost about the same as cooking their own, with an enormous combined savings in both time and expense for the entire building.

Wide building overhangs next to the sidewalks encouraged other informal vendors to spread their wares in weekly farmers’ markets and other commercial and social adventures. With its internal winding streets, small theaters, public baths and third places, and a petticoat surround of small market and social spaces, the buildings were more a self-contained village than a simple dormitory. Megan was high on the list to work in the Red Star outlet opening next month in the basement.

Megan was artful about her movements and mindful of the reason she was working. She delivered a consistent quality beverage. She’d watch the customer take the first sip, and was often rewarded by a glance and a grateful sigh. The tips were pooled, but the baristas got an extra share. Everything depended on the tamp.

Megan wore her hat to work, its red star echoing the antique posters on the walls. She’d read about the Paris Commune and figured someone had a sense of humor, or a cold ironic sensibility, turning this into a motif for a capitalist enterprise. Megan had her dad’s dirty blonde hair and her mom’s baby blue eyes. She filled her black Red Star Tee in her Title-Nine running bra and kept her tummy flat doing crunches. Most days at least one of the customers hung around and tried to talk. Not all were pervs. She missed Game time when she worked. It was torture to see all the customers logged in.

Essie restocked the candy jars. Old Gina and her older cousin Ndapewa had settled on the porch to watch the iilumbu tourists and chatter through the afternoon. Today they were sewing tops for the girls. The owner liked his staff to dress with tops and skirts, even the toilet maids. He sold the tops at the store for a price Essie could not believe, the greedy man. She bought cloth and thread and paid the old women to copy the designs. They sold them at a very reasonable price.

In the afternoon, the shop was busy as ever. Essie had reduced some prices, and now villagers from across the valley also came for provisions. She showed the owner how he would make so much more money if they sold this much oil and that much grain. At the end of this month, she would give him his money and ask for a small raise in her pay. Annaline told her what shop keepers down in Kamanjab and Etosha made. She now had friends in Junana who worked in shops in Windhoek and Keetmanshoop. He could not expect her to slave for him like this.

When the plane flew overhead she could do nothing but look out of the window toward the airstrip, hidden by river trees from her sight. Two customers were fighting over the same bolt of gingham cloth, and a line of children eyed the candy in the big glass jars on the counter.

“Tuamanguluka, buy some cinnamon sticks for your friends,” she said. Gina had told her the boy’s father had returned from selling his goats in Outapi. Tuamangulaka grinned and pulled a half-dollar coin from his pocket.

“My lord,” Essie said. “You will ruin all your teeth with that.” She took the coin and counted out ten sticks into his hands. He doled these out to the other children, keeping three for himself, and they ran from the shop shouting and hooting.

Essie convinced one of the women that she would look much better in a brighter printed cotton, which the other woman now eyed with envy. She made the sales and the shop was momentarily empty. Taking advantage of this, she closed and locked the door and put up the “back in five minutes” sign. She put on her hat and left by the delivery door, walking, not quite running toward the airstrip.

She had just started up the road when she saw the Rover coming towards her. It sped by her as she stood and watched. Mr. Steve5683 was in the passenger seat talking with the owner. He glanced at her and a sudden smile lit his face.

“Stop!” he shouted. “Stop right here.”

The Rover ground to a quick halt, and all the passengers braced themselves as the luggage tumbled forward. A cloud of dust rose from the tires. Essie walked toward the car as the passenger door opened and Mr. Steve5683 stepped out. Without thinking she ran up to him and fell to her knees, bowing and thanking him, just thanking him in English and Oshindonga and Oshikwanyama, all jumbled up with her tears.

“Get up Essie.” He took her forearm and pulled her to her feet. “There’s nothing to thank me for. Nothing.” The other passengers had stepped from the Rover, a woman and two children, one of them wearing the hat.

“I want you to meet my wife,” he said. “Essie, this is Kelly.” The woman stepped forward and took her hand.

“Your wife,” Essie said, her breath slowing. “Mrs. Steve5683. I am very, very, very....” The woman was so incredibly white. Hair like straw, eyes like the Camp pool, skin like buffalo milk. “...very happy to meet you.”

“Steve5683?”

The boy covered a laugh with his hand. “It’s his Junana user ID, mom. Hi, Essie, I’m Randy. Randy9140. He touched his hat and nodded.”

“So many Randys! But few as smart as this one, I bet.”

“Essie, this is our daughter Christa.” The little girl was amazing, so very beautiful.

“Oh my, aren’t you pretty.” Essie bent down. “Would you like to see a lion?”

“A lion!” She glanced up at her mother.

“Tomorrow, sweetie.”

Owner came around the car. “Is there trouble at the shop?”

“No, Taté.”

He frowned at her.

“I must get back,” she said. “Please excuse me.”

“We are off to a tented camp. When we get back, Essie, we must talk,” Steve said. “Today I have a lot of business to take care of, eh Heinrick?” He clapped the owner on his shoulder. They returned to the car and drove away.

The dust swirling up from the track muddied the tears on her face.
