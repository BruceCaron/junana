# Twenty Three
Scratchy woke up in a hospital bed with a pounding headache. The room was black. Electronic readouts shone on a dozen different devices. He was in a cotton gown and had a plastic wristband on his left wrist. Pushing against the blazing pain in his skull, he reached over and found the call button on its cord. He pressed this and fell back in the bed.

After some time the door opened, admitting a flash of flourescent light from the hallway. The nurse entered and squeak-walked over to his bed.

“Mr. O’hara. Feeling better?”

“Than what?” He closed his eyes. “The bitch slipped me a mickey.”

“Your blood chemistry was...” the nurse hesitated, “...unusual.”

“Got any aspirin, maybe some Vicodin?”

“Head hurt?”

“Ummm...” he groaned.

“I can give you some water. We don’t know exactly what you took, so we’re not going to give you anything that might complicate your condition.”

“They catch the blonde?”

“There was just you and the driver. Did you know you’re famous?”

“Tell me about it.” He turned over on his side and slid back into unconsciousness.

She opened the Cuca shop early, as if that would prompt Mr. Steve5683 to arrive. Of course, she wanted to run to their lodge and wake them up and get her surprise so that this sweet, awful thrill of anticipation would leave her. Instead, she cleaned up the storeroom and swept the shop twice, glancing out the window every five minutes. Last night the Game had reappeared. She spent most of the night on a new Query.

Ontibile, the giant camp guard, arrived and said she must close up the shop and follow him. He would not say where or why, and she had a moment of terror that Owner was angry with her and would throw her from the property. He walked out toward the village, up the track around a small kopje. Near the top of this, on its south side, she saw Mr. Steve talking with Owner.

“They are waiting,” Ontibile said and began to walk back to camp.

She climbed the hill, emboldened by Mr. Steve’s smile and wave. He was holding a large roll of paper and there was a big cardboard box at his feet. Owner was not smiling.

“Hello, Essie. I’ve been talking to my new partner. Heinrick is not convinced of my plan, but I am sure it is worth a try, if you are willing.”

“Good morning, Mr. Steve. Taté Owner, wa lala po,” she nervously greeted the owner in Oshindonga.

“His name is Heinrick, which you should use, now that we are all in this together.”

“I am confused,” she admitted.

“Look.” He unrolled the paper, and she saw blueprints for a building. “This is our new school. Here is the classroom, here the kitchen and bathrooms, and here the teacher’s apartment. The satellite dish goes on the roof. This hillside should provide clear reception.”

“School?”

“For Gamers.” He pulled a blue shoulder bag from the box at his feet and passed this to her. “Congratulations!”

She looked into the shoulder bag and pulled out the yellow blouse and a silver metal laptop computer.

“As the teacher, I think you will need one of these.” It was solid and smooth in her hand, an object from a distant star.

“The teacher? Oh, my!”

“If you agree.”

“What about my store?” Heinrick grumbled.

“Our store. While we are building the school, she can train her replacement.”

“Look!” Steve pointed to the box. Inside were at least a dozen new Computos.

“Who will be the students?” Essie asked, already thinking of two or three girls.

“Anyone you choose. You are completely in charge of the school. We will make a budget for supplies.”

A school. Her mind raced. This was a surprise like nothing she imagined. A school where others, like her, could join the great wide world inside the Game.

“But I have nothing to teach!” she said, feeling bewildered.

“That’s not what my Guide tells me,” Steve said. “You are on your way to become a Meister, and potentially a great one. The Game knows these things.”

“Oh, my!” She turned away to hide her face.

“The Game has new templates for teaching, and includes a whole style of play that Gamers can join in the classroom.”

“Gaming in the classroom! What happened to discipline and order?” Heinrick said.

“Taté Owner,” she turned to him. “Mr. Heinrick. Can you see why this is a very good idea?”

“What I see is a complete waste of good money and nothing but trouble ahead.” He frowned. She saw in his eyes what she had seen so many times before.

“When you look at us, you never see us at all, do you? You see us as we have always lived, so close to the dirt that we are little different from the antelope and the elephants. To you we are monkeys who have discovered beer, and you think that’s the way we should remain. But we are also your neighbors and your workers. Your customers do not need to watch us like they watch the zebras at a water hole. They will still come for the fish and the lions. And we can have dreams as great as yours.” She looked out across the valley. “...or greater.”

“You don’t seem any happier now then when you were scrubbing my toilets.”

“True, but my head is out of the dust.”

“Will this make any of them happy? All this education?”

“Nothing makes people happy. People make their own happiness.”

Steve laughed at that. “She’s quite the philosopher, Heinrick. I wouldn’t get into any debates with her. While you are building the school, I think she should move into cabin ten...”

Heinrick shook his head unhappily. He sometimes kept one of his mistresses in cabin ten.

“...and she can eat at the main dining room with the customers. I think they’ll enjoy her insights.”

“How long with it take to build the new school?” she asked.

“We can get all the materials up from Grootfontein in a matter of weeks,” Steve said. “Put the roof on before the rains start. I’ll order the solar panels from Durban tomorrow.”

“Why are you doing this?” Essie asked.

“Something my Guide said. “‘Stevo,’ Charley said to me, ‘you started something terrible when you gave that girl a Computo. She’s all alone now, with nobody to talk to but strangers on Junana. You have to get her some companions so she does not cry herself to sleep’.”

“Oh! Annaline!” Essie said. “My Guide was wicked to put this on you.”

“I’ve been looking for a project where I can give back to the places where my customers travel. Besides, I’m sure our customers will enjoy conversing with a whole school of Essies. I’m thinking of special tours just for Gamers. You don’t look convinced, Heinrick.”

“One Essie has been more than enough,” he grumbled.

Don Driscoll drove through the night, out into the desert. He stopped at a gas station with a minimart and filled the tank with his credit card. Then he went into store for some coffee.

“What do you want?” The clerk stood stiffly behind the counter.

“Coffee. You got a restroom?”

“Not for assholes like you.”

“What?”

“Hit the road, Driscoll!” The clerk raised his right arm, the one with the baseball bat in its hand. Behind him, a computer screen displayed Don’s face. Don backed to the glass door and used his body to push it open, still watching the clerk. He fled to his car and drove south.

§ § §

It was still dark out when a man dressed like a doctor arrived. He took Scratchy’s pulse. Scratchy opened his eyes.

“Count Slick sent me. I’m to stick around until your friend Winston arrives.”

“Winston!” Scratchy smiled.

“You feeling OK?”

“Guess I shouldn’t drink and passenger.” He could not remember anything after the blonde woman got into his cab. “I probably told them everything, I can’t remember.”

“Your friends are taking all reasonable precautions. You still have a plane to catch.”

“What about Timmy?”

“Timmy?”

“Owns the cab?”

“That’s him in the next bed.”

Scratchy looked over. All he could see was a vague form, asleep under the blanket. “What did she give us?”

The man picked up the chart from its hook on the wall. “They found traces of curare, LSD, PCP, and some alkaloids they can’t identify. Some serious shit. You’re lucky your breathing didn’t stop.”

“Will Timmy be OK?”

“He’s stable now. Here’s another call button for you.” He handed Scratchy a small beeper-like device. “You push it and I’m here.” He touched a bulge under his white coat and slid out of the room like a wraith.

One by one the Posse checked into the Abbot’s Abode and found their rooms at the Old House up on the crest of the hill. Jennifer arrived a day early to get a jump on the jet lag from Paris. She spent an entire afternoon indulging in the spa. One of the masseuses noticed the new tattoo on her shoulder, and, before she could object, she was getting royal treatment. It was a small tattoo of the crimson cloak.

Over the fall and winter, Jennifer had pushed through Level Five and Six and was now a Meister. She had been invited to Castalia where she met other Meisters in the castle on the hill. They had not yet opened Castalia for Sixers. The vast campus carried an abandoned-theme-park ambiance. The grounds were magnificent but lonely. The fountains ran, deer browsed,  and lupin bloomed on the hillsides, but there were only few people on the castle grounds. She had even met the Grand Meister, who welcomed her warmly, leaning on his staff while he asked her about her plans and goals.

Her cloak had arrived by express mail. The cloak was of heavy silk satin with a broad collar, bright crimson on the outside, lined in black. Not really street ready, although the previous week she’d seen a pair of Meisters, still just kids, strolling together in their cloaks. She packed the cloak away and went with the tattoo as a gift to herself.

Soaking in the herbal bath, she realized how much of her life she had set aside while pursuing the Game. She was shocked by her appearance in the spa’s mirrors. Months of inactivity and inattention had sapped away her muscle tone. She had gained several pounds and lost all of her tan. Simple on the outside, she reflected, beauty on the inside. Bullshit. She could almost hear Francesco say, “What’s the purpose of ‘beauty on the inside’ if it doesn’t show?”

Claire showed up in the early afternoon. She had left Megan at a friend’s house, where the mother was also wearing Game shoes. Megan said she was bored to death with the Santa Monica City College classes. She had been stalled in Level Five, unable to get the hang of unfolding templates in a few regions. With unlimited Free-for-All time, she spent most of her Gaming hours working out her homework or exploring topics that amused her.

Megan had developed an intellectual attitude that Claire found familiar and irritating. She acted like a sophomore at Swarthmore: grossly overconfident but fully prepared to back it up. Megan adored her shoulder bag and took it everywhere. In the previous week she went through a world religion phase, consuming the major Upanishads, the Prajnaparamita Sutra, and Tao Te Ching.

Claire checked in at the front desk and found a message from Winston. He had to run to Santa Barbara before coming back to Santa Fe, so he would spend the night in Albuquerque and arrive the next morning. She had a momentary regret that Winston would not be sleeping in the room across the hall tonight; something tingly had awakened in her at the thought. She dropped her bags in her room, switched to her Pumas and took a four mile walk on the bridle trail.

Alice arrived later in the afternoon. As she was a self-confessed gym-rat, a step-aerobic, cycle-spinning, Bikram yoga, pilates enthusiast, she dropped off her bags and headed for the fitness center to work out the kinks from the day’s travel.

Betsy, who needed a full day to recover from Mardi Gras, arrived last. Despite her careful but heartfelt entreaties, Annika had fallen hard for a Tulane University English professor who was in the Sixth Level of the Game. When that bitch showed up at The Leg Bar in the yellow blouse, Betsy knew it was over.

The mood at dinner had none of the usual triumphalism of the past retreats, where Con|Int’s annual growth was saluted with tequila and bonus checks got passed around. This table felt more like the wake for a close friend; forced laughter and small talk stretched thin over their anxiety.

Betsy gave hugs all around and they ate their green chile, posole, and sopapillas with rounds of Patron. The real meeting would not begin until the morning, so the talk drifted to events since they last met. This mainly centered on the Game and on Jennifer, whose Meister status gave Claire and Alice some kind of thrill. Claire said she was struggling with Level Six. Betsy found it hard to imagine Claire struggling with anything. She tried to catch Alice’s eye, but Alice was focused on some template-unfolding-conundrum conversation going on between Claire and Jennifer.

“If you don’t mind, I’m going to my room and slit my wrists.” Betsy stood.

“See you in the morning!” Alice said and turned around to her to touch her hand. Claire and Jennifer stopped their conversation for a minute to wish her good night. In a funk as dark as the sky, Betsy took the trail up to the Old House.

Harold Farmer sat in a darkened room with six high-definition screens arranged in a semi-circle. On each screen a face popped into view as their encrypted signal was approved. Once all the screens were filled, he opened up his speaker.

“Gentlemen and lady.” He nodded to Elza Frieberg on the screen second from the left. She lifted her chin in reply. “We have the code, and we have the talent. Once we unlock their new administrative system we will control Junana. In the meantime let’s finalize the advertising buy-in so we can build out the new plazas. I want to see results in weeks, not months. Are we all on the same page?”

“What about my budget,” Elza asked. “I gave you the new figures based on this accelerated schedule. We need another hundred digital artists to keep on track.”

“I got budget approval this morning. Hire whom you need.”

She sat back and smiled.

“Any other concerns?”

“What about the Game?” This came from Dickey Gronberg at Commerce.

“Our instructions are to shut it down.”

“Shut it down? Most of our high schools are running on it. The initial test scores are outstanding.”

“Forget the tests. We need a school system in step with our economy. Is there anything else?” The faces remained impassive.

“We’ll talk again in a week. I want to see progress across the board.” Harold moused the “End Conversation” button and the screens went blank.

Dickey Gronberg slammed his phone receiver back on the instrument.

“Ham fisted luddites!” he muttered. “Pontificating paranoid...”

“Sounds like they mean business,” Geoff said. Dickey had left the Game running while he was on the video phone.

“I can’t stop them.”

“We know.”

Another Guide popped into view. He looked vaguely familiar.

“Dickey, this is JS,” said Geoff. “He has a few questions for you, if you’re willing...”

The morning came with frost and bright mountain sun. Alice was up early for a run. Jennifer treated herself to room service and a hot bath. Claire and Betsy found each other at the restaurant.

“You disappeared early last night,” Claire said, sitting down across from Betsy, who set down her newspaper on the empty chair to her right.

“It’s been a busy week,” she said and sipped at her triple latte.

“We were all focused on Jennifer,” said Claire. “I didn’t even get a chance to ask about Mardi Gras.”

“Well, it rained the whole damn time, which happens when the calendar slips into March.”

“That’s a shame. But there’s still a party.”

“Best in the world.”

“How’d Annika like it?”

Betsy picked up her paper again. “You gonna order breakfast?” She leaned back with a scowl and opened it.

Claire took the signal and caught the eye of the waitress. Just as she was ordering, Alice arrived, dressed in her sweats. Alice had the capability of brightening a room like a halogen flood light just by striding through it. Trim and athletic, she bounced when she walked, which sent the millefiore trade beads in the corn rolls of her coiffure in motion. She had Pam Greer’s generous smile and Sharon Stone’s cheekbones.

Alice was a walking United Nations. Her mother was a mix of Haitian African and Taino on one side and an Anglo-Indian on the other. When she was a small child, the mother’s family escaped Haiti on a boat that ended up in Biloxi. Alice’s father’s mother was Norwegian and Chinese from Seattle. Her paternal grandfather emigrated to Vancouver as part of a Jewish family from South Wales.

Alice’s parents met when her father took a job at Stennis Space Center where her mother was working as clerk. Alice had emerald eyes, a cafe-au-lait complexion, a third-degree black belt in Aikido, and an unbridled sexuality. On the census form, Alice could use an “all of the above” box.

She gave Claire a hug and then went around to Betsy and gave her one too and a big smooch on the cheek along with a sly feel with her right hand that made Betsy start and then grin. Betsy pinched Alice on the butt, and Alice slapped her hand away playfully and sat down in the empty chair. The coffees came and then the omelets, and they were all talking about politics and movie stars and current events as if it were a year ago when these things still mattered.

Winston took the last plane out of LAX to Albuquerque, slept a few hours at an airport hotel, and rented a car as sun rose above the mountains east of town. On the road to Santa Fe, he grabbed an incendiary breakfast burrito from a bustling trailer kitchen. He had put Scratchy on Jack’s jet late yesterday afternoon up in Santa Barbara. By now, Scratchy was probably poolside at the Kona Cove.

Winston had done some research on Con|Int, which he discovered was one of the top consumer forecasting firms in the world. He checked out the profiles for Claire, Jennifer, and Alice on Junana, knowing these were precise and fairly comprehensive. Elizabeth Berteotti, the fourth member of Claire’s team, had no profile. He’d run into Betsy before.

Betsy Berteotti was a star among academic statisticians, a group with which Winston was obliquely connected. His own work on derivatives had made him somewhat famous in the same, admittedly tiny, circle. He had seen her speak at an American Statistical Association annual meeting a few years back.

Desi met Jennifer in Castalia when she became a Meister. He advised Winston to be on his guard. “Way, way too smart and beautiful for any one person,” was Desi’s assessment of Jennifer Bouchez. “Oh, my God! She could actually be a Guide in the game.”

Winston found the driveway to the Abbot’s Abode, checked in, and followed the bellhop up the hill to a separate house where his room was located on the second floor. The meeting was scheduled to start at 9:30. Winston unpacked, checked his emails, gargled away some of the habañero breath, slipped on his twenty-year old Orvis jacket and went downstairs. In the house’s living room, the furniture had been moved to the walls and a round table installed in the middle of the floor, with a projector and a screen against the back wall. The curtains were pulled against the sun. Doughnuts and coffee were offered up around the table.

Claire came up and gave him a hug, which they held a bit too long and then separated abruptly. Claire met his eyes and made this move with her eyebrows that Winston was trying to interpret while she introduced him to Alice, Jennifer, and Betsy.

“I went to your talk at the ASA some years ago,” Betsy said. He returned the compliment. Claire explained that they ran the mornings on pure sugar, fat, and caffeine, and then switched to yoghurt and whole grain muffins in the afternoon, which would include a hike through Bandelier National Monument.

“I’m afraid none of us is a morning person,” she explained.

“I’m not sure what my role is here,” Winston confessed as he took a seat.

“You’ve been fairly astute in predicting trends about the effects of the Game,” Betsy said. “We are now in the same business. Feel free to speak up whenever you have some input.”

“We’ll interrogate you after the doughnuts are gone,” said Jennifer.

“Must avoid getting blood splattered on the pastries,” Alice added.

Betsy went to the laptop and cued up the first slide.

“I’m going to start with the obvious,” she said. “since all of you are already addicted to this Game. I’m sorry. Winston, are you a player?”

“Just earned my shoulderbag.”

“Way to go!” Alice said.

Jennifer gave him a nod, and Claire did that thing with her eyebrows again, which meant she wasn’t doing it because of his burrito breath.

“The Game is probably, make that unequivocally, the finest piece of learning technology to hit the streets since Socrates wandered Athens. Whoever built this managed to combine a content engine with...Alice, would you please stop!”

Alice was unconsciously doing the Wanda and Jorge motions with her hands.

“Sorry.” Her hands dipped back to her lap.

“Creeps me out,” Betsy muttered. “Where was I? Oh, right. Well, the point is, whoever they are, they did the pedagogy part so right that we can pretty much call this the future of education for the planet.”

Winston suppressed a smile as all the good feelings of a proud father listening to a glowing report about his baby daughter welled up inside of him.

“The templates...” Jennifer said. Betsy held up her hand.

“You can talk in a minute, Jenn. Let me finish.”

“On the technology side,” Betsy continued. “they might as well be some alien invaders. There is nothing to compare this to in terms of scale and performance. The throughput on this system accounts for more than half the capacity of Ariadne.” She put up a slide that illustrated the growth of the Game over the past year.

“Look. It’s exponential, like bacteria on a growth medium,” she noted.

“Or like a great hit song,” Jennifer said. “Like you said, this is a marvelous teaching machine.”

“Now that the source code is out, we know that O’hara has accomplished the mesh computer,” Betsy took back the conversation. “On the social side, Junana.com, which was the first product by the Game makers, has pretty much reversed the common wisdom about anonymity on the Internet. It turns out that people prefer honesty in their online interactions. Of course, Tony Geddens told us that years ago.

“There are certain consequences to this honesty. Young people, kids still in high school, will now need to look into their futures and realize that they will always be in touch, or at least in reach of everyone they meet. Not only does Junana.com impose an honesty about the past, it projects this into the future. You can run, but you can no longer hide. Here is the real digital village, where neighbors know what you sing in the shower, and how you downloaded it.

“When we look closer at the Game...” Betsy was watching Jennifer. “We begin to see the corrosive, dangerous, even deadly consequences that are only now emerging.”

Alice and Claire burst out in protests, while Jennifer and Betsy held eye contact. Winston felt like he had been stabbed in the gut. Betsy let the ruckus subside.

“This is precisely what I’m getting at,” Betsy continued. “The Game consumes its players emotionally with a cult-like grip. They want to believe that it’s all pretty and nice, sugar and spice. But it’s not, is it, Jennifer?”

Jennifer absorbed the gaze of the room for a minute. Betsy’s question had brought into instant focus a haze of misgivings that she’d pushed to the side in the Sixth Level. Why were some templates so easy to unfold and others so difficult? Why was the track of her progress not entirely of her own volition? Just what and who controlled the boundaries of the Game?

“No, it’s not,” she admitted. “But I don’t see any malevolence in it.”

“So far, the Game has killed more people than any terrorist group in modern history,” Betsy said, and put up the slide on suicide rate increases.

“You can’t blame that on the Game!” Winston blurted. “There’s got to be some other reason...”

“The real problem,” Betsy growled, “is not clinical depression, although reports of depression remain significantly higher than before the Game. In fact, the future is so dark you’ll need to wear night goggles.”

She switched to the next slide, a multigraph of trends, all moving higher over time. “The sleeping killer here is anomie.”

“’Aujourd’hui, maman est morte. Ou peut-être hier, je ne sais pas,’” Jennifer whispered.

“What was that?” asked Claire.

“Camus. In Paris we suckle our infants in anomie. So I’m not sure where this is going.”

“I thought anomie went out with Durkheim,” Alice said.

“Well, it’s back,” said Betsy. “When it comes to the real world, millions of players, many of them teenaged, just don’t give a flying fuck anymore. Fortunately, whoever is doing the Game has the balls to let others pull statistics from it. In fact, the Game is now the single best source of consumer information ever assembled. Only now we don’t just get opinions about laundry detergent, we can look into the minds of the players and find out how they actually think.”

“The Game doesn’t give access to player-level personal information or even aggregates of this,” Winston said.

“Sure, but the Game keeps careful track of its templates, and how many players fold and unfold these. The template structures are semantically coded, so we can pull meaningful inferences from them. Once you make the assumption that the players internalize the templates as guidelines for their thoughts and actions, you can normalize the player population according to their exposure to the various template structures.”

“So you don’t need to know anything about the players other than which templates they have unfolded?” Winston was impressed. Betsy might be the only person on the planet capable of pulling this off.

“Correctamundo,” Betsy said. “Do you guys want the gory details, or should I just cut to the fucking chase?”

“It’s your report,” Claire said, again extremely happy Betsy was on her team.

“We are all on the fast train to Nerdville,” Betsy said, and clicked forward rapidly to a slide that said just that. She continued.

“I’m sure the Game makers thought they were setting up some kind of universal learning tool that would enable the players to imagine whatever future they had in mind. But take a look...”

She keyed the next slide, which showed a complex topic cloud with maybe five hundred nodes where thin lines connecting these into some sort of ontological web.

“This is a representation of the tippy-top level of the global knowledge-space as we know it today, including emotional intelligence. You can see music, art, philosophy, psychology, physics, sociology, intimacy, reflexivity, empathy: it’s all here. This map represents everything we think is possible to learn.”

She toggled the next slide. The same topic cloud, but within it a very small number of the nodes were now highlighted in red.

“This is the current learning space of the Game,” she said. “If we overlay Gardner’s intelligences on the total learning space, you’ll note that the Game completely avoids musical, spatial, body-kinesthetic, and intrapersonal intelligences. The players can ace their SATs, but they can’t hold a basic conversation, except maybe with their Guides.”

Winston slumped in his chair. This was all news to him, and none of it good.

“Nerdville,” Jennifer spoke. She walked up to the screen. “Of course. Since this is where we—all of us in the room at least—already lived, we didn’t see it coming. Merde!”

“The people who designed the Game likely never figured that they were imprinting it with the contours of their own screwed up lives. So why not screw up the rest of the world? If this was their plan, they are right on target.”

“The Game covers social processes, technology, architecture, history. Look, there’s even anthropology,” said Winston defensively.

“Where’s the music?” Betsy asked.

“Where’s the art?” Alice added.

“Where’s the intimacy?” Claire asked. “All of this is just content without emotion: rational, sophisticated, astute even. But so thin, it’s like a veil. Where’s the complexity, the ambiguity, that confusion of flavors, colors, and smells we can sense all around us? Where is the real world in this?”

“Nerdville,” Jennifer repeated. “It smells like the stacks in the graduate library.”

“When only one percent of the population are nerds, at least there’s a market for their talents. Nerds have done pretty well of late,” Betsy noted. “But when half the population are nerds, what the hell are they supposed to do? Do you think they are going to be happy checking people out at the supermarket? Flipping burgers at Wendy’s? We are looking at tens of millions of radically disenchanted individuals, intellectually stimulated only in the Game. Outside of this: socially stunted and emotionally crippled. An enormous cohort of underemployed, underappreciated, intensely unhappy geeks. Clones of whomever manufactured this monstrosity. Nerdville, here we come.” Betsy stood by the computer, triumph spilled across her face. She looked at Jennifer, who held her head in her hands. The room fell silent.

“We know who programmed the game,” Betsy said. “Maybe we can find some way to contact them.”

The next slide was an old photo of Scratchy from when he won his first Neo. “Michael O’hara, of recent fame. We know he’s the source for the mesh computer.”

The next slide showed Desi in a suit, again from his prior life in the dot-com world. “Desikacharya Venkataraman is a genius with language. He did the multilingual programming for Junana.”

“He’s also the first Grand Meister,” Jennifer said. “I’ve met him.”

When he became Grand Meister, Desi had given up masquerading his avatar, and went with a straight image of himself, over Jack’s protest.

“I’ve got other duties now,” Desi had argued. “And these require my sincerity. I can’t hide anymore.”

The next slide showed Itchy.

“Ichiro Nomura, the wizard of the avatar: the Game Guides are his masterpiece.”

Winston glanced at Claire, who was staring directly at him. He looked back at the screen and then glanced again. Her eyes made contact. She was nodding.

“I think Winston has something to say,” Claire said. “Or should I?”

“I can’t stop you.”

“They all have something in common.”

“I know that none of them have a profile on Junana,” said Betsy.

“They all shared a house at college,” Claire said. “Them, and also Winston here.”

The room turned in his direction.

“So it’s probable Winston is a principal in the Game project,” Betsy announced.

Winston shrank down in his chair like he was imagining they were velociraptors ready to pounce.

“You built the Game?” Jennifer asked.

“It seemed like the thing to do at the time.”

“Thank God,” she said. “Then it’s not too late.”

“Too late for what?” Betsy said.

“Version 2.0.” Jennifer stood.

“You mean fix it?” asked Betsy.

“You said the technology rocks and the learning engine, too. It’s just the content that needs work.”

“So, what is the cure for anomie? Music? Art? MTV?” Winston also stood up and leaned on the table. “How about some common sense?”

“What does your common sense tell you now?” Claire asked.

“Shut it down.”

“No!” Jennifer slammed her hand on the table top. “There is nothing wrong with the Game except for its founding moment.”

“I’m still not sure we need to blame the Game for people’s unhappiness,” said Alice. “All the Game did was wake them up, show them the world in a new light. The world masks unhappiness through its ongoing, globalized consumer circus.  What’s so great about being happy and stupid? The templates simply unfold an awareness of the real and symbolic violence that surrounds us.”

“Sure, you can argue that suicide makes sense in a world so sad,” Winston said. “but I’m not at all comfortable about my part in this.”

“You didn’t create the world,” Claire said. “You just held up the mirror.”

“These are only kids!” Winston slumped down holding his head in both hands. He kept thinking: the Game is killing people.

“We need to have some other voices in this conversation.” Winston noticed the speaker phone in the middle of the table. “Is that hooked up?”

Winston sent out a coded text message from his cell phone, an alarm that would be announced by particularly obnoxious ring tones on each of the Nerds’ phones. He gave them the number for the speaker phone.
