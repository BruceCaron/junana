# Sixteen
Castalia was going to be a special location in Junana, restricted to those Gamers who had achieved the very highest levels. Jack had first suggested this to Desi and Itchy, and they agreed it would serve the Game well to have a space for conversation among the Meisters. Itchy insisted that Castalia be template inspired, and set out to unfold architectural templates for the entire site. Perhaps because of his affection for the clean lines of Shoin Japanese architecture, or maybe because this style was unconsciously templated, the buildings spread across a cypress-covered hillside with sweeping tile roofs supported by tree-trunk sized posts. Platforms of dazzling terrazzo mosaics formed the floors.

Itchy had the luxury of designing the site itself. He specified an escarpment to the west, a slow-running stream on the east, and a gentle slope to the south with an expansive lawn maidan edged by a thick forest. Temperature had no meaning in the Game, but Itchy wanted Castalia to move through the days and seasons. He set the clock arbitrarily for Oregon time, but he moved the latitude up to Vancouver, lengthening the summer twilight and chopping the days in winter.

At the center of Castalia, up on the hill, he placed an actual castle, in medieval French style, with a moat and turrets where flags of many colors showed their griffin crests to the winds. In the center of the castle was its Keep, a round, windowless, doorless tower, with a single large flag: a huge white owl on a crimson background. This space would be reserved for the Meisters. Itchy sent a message to Desi, who had become the first player to master Level Seven in the Game. He called Desi the Game’s first winner. Grand Meister Desi replied. “I think rather the Game has won me.”

“The interior space should respond to the uses you envision the Meisters making for it.” Itchy said.

“Then it must be clear and level, with no hint of hierarchy. Not a place for politicking, and the only reason it’s separate is for personal privacy. Think of it like the Room, only big enough for, say, five hundred people.”

Claire finally got Megan to sit down for dinner when she noticed Megan was wearing a pair of brown shoes. They looked oddly familiar. Megan was trying to tell her something about how the design of the kitchen reminded her of some template she had unfolded. Claire kept asking about the shoes.

“Where did you get these shoes?” Claire asked Megan for the third time.

“These? I earned them,” Megan replied. She looked down at her feet and smiled.

“You mean you earned some money somewhere and bought them?” Claire asked. “I give you an allowance for clothes.”

“Nope. They just appeared in the mail. But first, I earned them on the Game.”

“Can I see one?”

“Sure,” Megan lifted her foot and slipped off the shoe. She handed this to her mom. Claire took this and turned it over and over. It was the same type that was passed around at the Rind meeting. Frowning, she held it up and looked inside.

“There’s only a label that says what the shoes are made of. Nothing about who made them.” The shoe was totally non-woven, some sort of felt for the upper, and the sole was the same deep coffee brown material sewn into a flat surface. The label said they were made of recycled fibers.

“These won’t last long,” she predicted. “But they look really comfortable.”

“They’re the shit! I can wear them all day. Now that I earned them, I can order more.”

“Like you ordered these?”

“No, these just came.”

“You say you ‘earned’ the shoes?”

“I can also earn the hat,” Megan replied.

“The hat?” Of course, she remembered Jennifer’s last report. Avatars were now sporting a hat. Jennifer noted it was shaped like a Mao cap, in black, with a red star on it.

“There’s a shoulder bag, and a blouse, and a cape. The Grand Meister has a staff.”

“Just how do you earn all this?”

“On the Game,” Megan replied. “I’ve been telling you about the Game for a year now. And you always say I don’t listen,” she mocked, wagging her finger.

“That’s because you’re always playing on the computer. And you don’t listen, at least not when I’ve got a chore for you to do.”

“I’m not just playing on the computer. Not when I’m in the Game. I’ve been telling you for months.”

So had Jennifer, but who has time for a video game?

“I’m listening now.”

“I should let you know a few things, then.” In a most dramatic tone.

Claire did not like the sound of that, and she must have shown it.

“Nothing bad,” Megan placed her hands palm down on the table. “Don’t lose it, OK?”

“OK. So what’s up?”

“Well, for starters, I graduated from high school last week.”

“You what?” Claire knew better than that. “Young lady, it’s the middle of the summer after your freshman year. In three weeks you will be pestering me to raise your allowance so that you can throw away hundreds of dollars of perfectly fine clothes and replace these with other clothes that are different how?”

“Yeah, right. Isn’t that what keeps you employed? Besides, I don’t think I need to go the high school anymore. After I earned my shoes I heard that others have been taking the test, you know, the test that shows you’ve passed high school. They put the test on the Web. And, well, I did it. And I passed no problem. Easiest test I ever took. I was wondering if I really need to, you know, go back next year.”

“To high school?”

“I mean it’s going to be so lame. And, besides, I’m going to college already. It’s part of the Game.”

“You’re what!” Claire was falling behind in the comprehension derby here.

“It’s the shit, mom. When you earn your shoes you can go on to the next level, and the word is, when you pass that level its as good as getting through, I mean actually like, finishing, you know, college. And you can get a real degree from it, and a hat.”

“But sweetie, high school is, well, more than just classes.” Claire found herself groping for something to say that wouldn’t sound entirely insincere. She had hated going to high school, could not wait for it to end. “There’s socialization, meeting people, meeting boys, time to grow up and find out about things before you get into college.”

“Like drugs, sex and music?” Megan said. “I thought you said I should wait until college before I...

“...And getting into a real college is not easy. It means taking all those advanced placement courses in math and science.”

“There’s kind of something else,” Megan started.

“I knew it.” Claire sighed. Megan was just sixteen.

“No.” Megan put her hand on her stomach. “Oh, my God, you are so not right!”

“What else is there?”

“It’s not bad, but I didn’t tell you. I mean until today. So, I don’t want you to go all apeshit that I didn’t tell you sooner.”

“Today it is. And I promise to not go any kind of shit.”

“Here, look.” She passed a light blue piece of paper to Claire and sat back, a small smile played at the edges of her mouth.

It was a form from the College Testing Service. Megan’s name was on it and some kind of test results. Claire stared the paper for the longest time.

“I could find a defibrillator, if it would help,” Megan offered.

Claire looked at her daughter, the same person who, a year ago, was still horrified with the knowledge that her childhood would be forever pony-less.

“This is a spoof, right? Something you printed from the Internet.”

Megan was shaking her head and smiling full on.

“This says you scored 2400 on the college entrance exam.”

“Right there in plain English. Another reason why another year in high school makes very little sense to me. I’m sixteen. They can’t hold me if I don’t want to go.”

“You’ve got to show me this game.”

§ § §

“You will inform the First Lady it’s Reverend Gerry.” Gerald Bishop reclined in his walnut-lined office, a nearly exact replica of Howard Hughes’ office at TWA. “Yes, I’ll hold.”

He cradled the phone’s handset between his face and shoulder as he scanned the market reports on his sermon on the evils of online social networks and gaming.

“The First Lady will be with you momentarily,” the White House operator announced. Gerry pushed the papers away and reclined in the leather chair.

“Reverend?” now it was Arlene Stone’s voice. “How good of you to call.”

“Arlene, you sound fit today, how are things with Grumpy?” Gerry had been acting as both pastor and therapist for Arlene Stone since she joined the church in San Antonio two years before she and the President first met.

Life in the White House had been complicated by President Stone’s long-term recovery from alcoholism. So many of the first couple’s official social responsibilities required at least the performance of drinking. W.G. had been falling off the wagon so regularly that Arlene called it his pogo stick. They hadn’t hosted an official state dinner in years, but whenever he traveled it took weeks to pull him back to the straight and narrow. The process made him grumpy, which she understood. When the most powerful man in the world can’t have a beer, he regards this as an injustice. She also understood it was her role to act as both the loyal supporter and the ultimate enforcer. Someone had to be strong.

“You heard what happened on the Freddy Earl show?” she said.

“How did Wilson take it?”

“He’s been in a black mood for days now. It’s so good of you to call; you always seem to know when I’m distressed.”

“Well, Arlene, what kind of pastor would I be if I were too busy for my favorite parishioner? I am also calling to get your opinion on my Crusade. Did you happen to see the service on Sunday?”

“I did, and I cannot agree more. Kids today learn nothing but bad manners playing all these games all day long. How are they going to learn about respect for their betters? Maybe that’s why that fellow attacked the President on Freddy’s show.”

“It would not surprise me in the least. And that’s why I’m hoping the President will throw some resources into our struggle. Nothing much. A little White House team to coordinate some of the capabilities over at Justice and Commerce.”

“I overheard W.G. talking with Karl about investigating that nasty O’hara fellow. He’s one of those computer people. Probably played too many video games as a child.”

“You know, Arlene, I have great respect for Karl.” The same kind of respect he’d give a black mamba. “But I’m thinking that you and Tom Verplanck were such a great duo last Christmas...”

Tom, the President’s domestic advisor, had devised a Christmastime program for the First Lady. She collected and distributed presents for the children of HIV-infected illegal immigrant mothers along the border.

The “No Border to Christ’s Love” campaign demonstrated to the entire nation that there was no one too wretched as to fall outside the compassionate reach of the White House. Bishop’s church cooperated fully and collected all the presents for distribution. Of course Stone had been elected on a platform that promised to stop illegals from access to medical attention. “Let ‘em go home to get treatment,” was Stone’s stump speech, and the church backed him to the hilt. The images of the First Lady holding little HIV babies on her lap surrounded by teddy bears and toy trucks sent the opposition into fits of self-righteous apoplexy. Bishop was a big fan of creative irony.

“...This is a domestic matter. Maybe you and Tom could put together a Tiger Team to push the agenda forward. We need to move ahead.”

“Well, I guess...”

“You’ve been hiding yourself far too much, dear Arlene.” Bishop had played this game with her before. “On Sunday I’m going to unleash a flood of support for the cause. The foot soldiers are in place, but we need tactical support to bring this off. I’m asking you to be my lieutenant. I...” He let his voice crack.

“Oh, Reverend!”

“I need your help. God needs your help. He put you in your position of power, and now it’s time to act.”

“My, my, my goodness,” Arelene stuttered. “Is it so important?”

“Arlene, you have no idea.”

“You have my full support, Reverend. I’ll ask Tom to call you today.”

“Bless you, my child. And tell Grumpy I’m praying for him.”

“We are all here except Michael,” Jack said.

“I’ve got some concerns about the learning programs for the Guides....” Itchy started.

Scratchy’s avatar appeared. “What’s up?” He leaned against the fireplace.

“Hi, Mikey,” said Desi. His avatar moved to give a hug.

“Who called for this meeting?” said Michael. He let Desi hug him, but made no move to return the gesture.

“Aren’t you sleeping? You sound terrible,” Desi said.

“Sasha and Skrotum are dead,” Scratchy said. His voice caught on the words.

“Oh, my God, Mikey!” Desi said. “How?”

“Poison, the vet told me. A slab of ahi with enough strychnine to clear out Hamelin. Someone threw it over the fence during the night. My tenants found their bodies in the garden.”

Since the day he posted the template code, Scratchy had been living in one or another of Tad’s hotels. The Lotta Vista house continued to be under surveillance by the paparazzi and unknown others. Scratchy rented it out to an engineering professor and her husband at a fraction of its market value, in exchange for them looking after his beloved cats.

“So shall you hear of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts...” Itchy intoned, “...of accidental judgements, casual slaughters, of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause.” He had played Horatio in the Reed production of Hamlet.

“Dirty tricks,” Scratchy said. “Retaliation.”

“Who would be so mean as to poison poor Skrotum?” Winston asked.

“Disgruntled ex-employee? Psychotic neighbor? Jealous lover?” Desi ventured.

“Nah, my bet’s on Stone.”

“I never thought Stone would sink that low,” Itchy said.

“His staff might, especially Karl,” Jack offered. “If Karl is on your case, you might consider leaving town. Put some distance between yourself and whomever he’s hired to do his dirty work. I’m very sorry about your cats.”

“Sasha was a beauty, and Skrotum, well, he was one of a kind.”

Scratchy had picked them up at an animal shelter in Solvang. Sasha was a magnificent Russian Blue, twenty pounds of muscle and a shimmering blue-grey coat. Independent and unpredictable. Every few days he’d let Scratchy touch him.

Skrotum was a runt. He looked like he’d died and been buried for a week and then showed up again at the back door. Maybe six pounds wet, his short fur was a dull grey, his tail and stomach were nearly bare. Skrotum had sneaky yellow eyes and a permanent slink. He looked guilty even when asleep. His head was misshapen from years of getting the shit kicked out of him by a range of backyard critters: other cats, possums, raccoons, and probably even garden rats. He was eternally brave on the attack, but lacked the talent to prevail. Scratchy spent a fortune keeping him alive.

Skrotum got his name when Scratchy took him in to get neutered. He thought he had a female cat, but the vet told him that the kitten was male, only the testicles had failed to descend. So the cat was christened ‘Skrotum’ for this defect, although Scratchy later thought about renaming him ‘Fester,’ after his many wounds. Skrotum lived on a diet of amoxicillin and tuna. The cat had an atavistic attachment to Scratchy’s lap, and he would sleep in it for hours, curled up into a flatulent ball. He managed to get along with Sasha, attacking him only irregularly. Sasha would send him tumbling with one swipe.

“Alas, poor Skrotum, I knew him well,” Itchy said.

“Ichiro Nomura! That’s enough, already. Can’t you tell, Michael is in distress!” Desi admonished him.

“Sorry, Mike.”

“That’s OK. Rosencarl and Guildenlenny are dead,” Scratchy mumbled, “But I’m staying put. Fuck Stone and his minions.”

“You tell ‘em, Mikey!” Desi said. “Say the word and I’ll fly over to stand with you.”

“Anything we can do, just say so,” Winston added.

“If you insist on staying in Santa Barbara,” Jack said, “I suggest you sell your car. Otherwise you’re likely to find it filled with heroin or cocaine and under police surveillance.”

“Great, now I won’t even have a car.”

“Find a taxi service.”

“How do we get even?” Scratchy said.

“Leave that to me,” Jack said, in a voice that quieted the others.

Beneath her bedroom the condo garage door closed with a thunk. Megan smiled as she stretched and yawned. Her Saturday just got simplified. Her mom was probably committed to some international telecon lasting most of the day. She did the brainwave in bed, sending her hands into complex motion in front of her face.

Megan stumbled to the bathroom to pee, her eyes adjusting to the dawn. Coming back to her room she threw on a t-shirt and moused her computer awake. The Game was already booted.

“Greetings, Miss Megan.” Bobby was dressed in his monk’s robe, dark brown with a flaxen rope belt. He bowed and she nodded in response.

Their avatars stood at the entrance to a medieval village, a double row of rough wooden huts arranged along a hillside. Smoke drifted lazily from the chimneys. Chickens scurried after grubs in piles of refuse. A stream of suspiciously colored liquid ran down the middle of the road separating the huts.

“This is Level Four,” he said. He glowered at her under the robe’s hood. “Follow me.” He ducked into the closest hut.

It’s one of those days, she mused to herself with a sigh and sent her avatar after him. She had figured the fun times from yesterday were a prelude to something serious. Now, here it was. The hut’s interior was candlelit. Bobby threw back his cowl and took a stance to face her.

“In Level Three, I introduced you to Simplicity,” he said. “Now you must show me you can unfold this template to its root.”

“And when I do?”

“If you fail, I will drag you back to Level Two and you can start over from there.”

“Nobody’s talking fail here. What happens when I take this template down?”

“You want Free-for-All time?”

“Yes, and...” She put a broad smile on her avatar. He frowned in response.

“Fantasy land, as well?” His eyebrows lifted. “You think that’s what you deserve? Do you know how many players have already done this without making such demands?”

“Just for an hour or so. It’s only pixels!” She leaned her avatar forward and kissed him on the cheek.

“Two hours of Free-for-All and one hour of fantasy.” His frown morphed into a grin. She guessed he expected her to ask for more than that.

“What are we waiting for? Show me the capstone for this puppy.” Her screen faded. The familiar Query UI appeared, the central video screen surrounded by sliders that allowed her to zoom through, into, or away from the montage of images, audio, and text the Game tossed at her in response to her questions and commands. She adjusted her headphone and its microphone and settled in her chair.

“Show me complexity,” she said.

“Good start.” Bobby’s voice told her.

The screen filled with images: tangles of wires, of neurons and ganglions, random piles of scrap, jumbled facades in a crowded street, transportation circuitries, confounding circuit diagrams. In her headset, a barrage of urban noises: roaring traffic, customers shouting orders, sibilant factory rhythms. She studied the images, her attention caught on a picture of a crowded street. She jabbed the pause button, backed up the presentation a couple seconds, and selected the image of a single building.

“Show me this.”

“Whatever did you find?” Bobby’s voice asked.

“Right in the middle of everything, here’s a building that seems to exist on its own. Like a flower in the middle of a bog. It’s so beautiful. But there’s nothing to it. Just concrete and glass.”

The Query showed the entire street as a panorama as it assembled information on the architect, Arata Isasaki, and the building’s isometric form.

A house, she reflected. In the middle of such confusion, which only makes its simplicity somehow work where it would be wasted on its own.

“I see a relationship between simplicity and complexity, some kind of necessary context.

“You are very close to the capstone template for simplicity,” Bobby encouraged her.

“It’s like a dance between them. Or a game of hide and seek. Or maybe a love affair.”

“Excellent,” said Bobby. “‘Simplicity loves difference.’ Remember. Nothing is more boring than the simple without complex; these are two sides of the same page. If you toss out difference you destroy simplicity. Let’s explore this template further.”

The Query screen lit up with a series of examples similar to the one she had discovered, but ranging from a tangle of tree roots around a stone Buddha head to the interior and exterior of an iPhone.

Over the next six hours, which passed like so many minutes, Megan, with Bobby’s gentle hints, Queried through all of the simplicity templates. “Simple Underneath” forced her to look through complexity and find the one thing that make the complex simple; she learned to still the motion in order to feel the undergirding calm. “Simple on the Outside” taught her how much more she trusted simple interfaces: light switches, stairways, T-shirts, her Game shoes, her favorite computer user interfaces. “Simple Saves Time” told her to be direct, find the short cut, see the fun in efficiency. “Simple anchors Emotion” explored the complex emotional embrace humans make with the world around them. Only it was not complex once you found the simple key.

“Simple Choice Starts It All.” This is where simplicity sockets into the root Noel template. In the end everyone must “Choose One.”

“What did you choose?” Bobby asked.

“I chose to open the door to the Game,” Megan said.

“At that time you had no attachment to it. When did that happen?”

She reflected. At some point during Level One she began to hunger for the Game. Something in it filled her time, her head, her heart with more than she had expected. She could not remember a single moment.

“I don’t know,” she said, feeling stupid. Bobby had noticed her initial distain for the Game.

“But you did emerge from Level One with a real intention. And that’s the next template structure we will explore: ‘Intentionfull.’ But not now. Now you have earned your Free-for-All time and your fantasy.”

“Fantasy first! I’m thinking Cheyenne, on the prairie, before contact. Make it super real. I want to feel the wind on my face...” She settled back in her chair. Her bedroom was bathed in sunlight. At once she felt hungry, grimy, and the need to pee again. Her morning breath had congealed into some kind of bad cheese odor. Her stomach let out a muted roar. “You know, I’ve got to eat something. Let’s do this later.”

“At your leisure.” Bobby bowed and the screen went black.

Megan stumbled toward the bathroom, stripping off her clothes. On the glass shower door was the handwritten sticky note Claire left.

“Morning, Meglie. I’m back mid-afternoon. Pancake batter is in the fridge with fresh fruit salad. New bread in the bin for sandwiches. Today is laundry day. Let’s do the Grove, I need some new towels. Italian on Montana for dinner? love ya. Mum. P.S. Remember you promised to walk Mrs. Jenkins’s pug this morning.”

Megan crumpled the note and dropped it in the wastebasket. She warmed the water and stepped in. A quick shower and she would take little Ruggles next door for a walk. As she closed the shower door, she heard the garage door open.

“Busted,” she whispered, and leaned into the shower spray.
