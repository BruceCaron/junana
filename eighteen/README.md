# Eighteen
Don was ready when he got his alert. One of the five anonymous users had logged onto Junana.com. Within minutes all of them had logged on. One by one they were taking a transporter to a goth scene. He identified the plaza of one of them the minute they logged in and sent his invisible avatar there too. He spied the goth transporter and moved closer. The plaza was thick with avatars moving about singly or in small groups. Ahead, a line of them dressed in jet black shrouds with flaming blue hair and long steel fingernails streamed into the goth transporter.

Don moved up to the transporter and spied an avatar walking aimlessly nearby, dressed like something out of pre-war Scottish film. He’s about as goth as my Aunt Tilda, Don figured as the avatar closed in on the transporter. It took one last look behind, its eyes moving across Don’s without stopping and stepped into the light. Don followed immediately. Instead of a goth scene, he ended up in a room that looked like someone’s private study with five overstuffed leather recliner chairs in the middle of the floor. Besides the one, four others were waiting, laughing over something. Don slid his avatar into a corner and watched.

“I’ve been talking with Desi and Ichiro about setting up a special destination available only to Sixers and above,” Jack said. “So we can pool their knowledge. Something like this room, only, of course, bigger.”

“Like the Vatican, Jack?” Scratchy said.

“More like a college campus,” Itchy said.

“Sounds like a fucking fraternity.” Scratchy said. “Shouldn’t these people be out there influencing others instead of hanging around in the Game?”

“Are we still managing the load all right? How is the mesh holding up?” Winston asked.

“Beautifully!” Desi said. “We are mirroring most of our administration server processes on the mesh now too. We can move the whole project off of the server farms within a month.”

“This console will be the admin console for the entire Game. When we get Castalia set up, we’ll move the Room there,” Itchy said.

“Castalia?” Scratchy asked.

“That’s what we’re calling the campus for Sixers and above.”

“Figures. Since I’ll never play, I guess I can retire and focus on the clusterfuck that’s become my life.”

“Michael. You will always be welcome in Castalia, even if you never play the Game,” Desi said, placing his hand on Scratchy’s shoulder. “And after the IRS is through with you, we will all try to help get a computer for your cell up in Lompoc. Won’t that be nice?”

“My point, Michael...” Jack said and his avatar projected the irritation in his voice. “...is this. Sixers and Meisters are the main product of our Game and we need to be in conversation with them.”

“I’ll second that.” Desi said. “I’m getting feedback from the Fivers I’m talking to that the Game is overwhelming their lives. A lot of them say they really miss their Guides. Maybe talking with other players would help them get over this.”

“I can program a VOG to let players know that they have been invited,” Itchy said.

“VOG?” Winston asked.

“Voice of God,” Itchy said. “An announcement from the Game itself.

“I don’t think we need a burning bush,” Winston said.

“Could use a burning blunt,” Scratchy said, shaking his head.

“Just because you never had a best friend!” Desi said.

“I thought you were my best friend.”

“I’m Winston’s best friend,” Desi said. Scratchy looked at Winston.

“I’m Jack’s best friend,” Winston looked at Jack, who managed to shake his avatar’s head.

“I’m Ichiro’s best friend,” he said. Scratchy turned to Itchy.

“Hey, I’m Desi’s best friend.”

“You are, you skinny boy,” Desi said. Then they all managed to double over laughing while Scratchy pulled his seppuku suicide stunt and lay there bleeding rivers onto the floor.

Don jotted a note about Michael and the IRS. He had a total of five names now. Michael, who had to be O’hara, someone named Desicachario Venkataram or something like that, someone they called Itchy or Ichiro, Winston, and Jack. The fifth guy did not seem to be in critical path on the programming side, so he was probably a money man.

Don had been standing quietly in the corner, confident of his invisibility, but every so often the one they called Meister would look around at his corner, as though he could sense something different in the space. Don desperately wanted to stick around, but his nerves gave out and he logged off. He now had another plan in mind. It was more dangerous to his employment, but it would allow him access to that console.

The way it sounded, they wouldn’t need a sysadmin in a month anyhow. Mr. “I’ve got another Neo, aren’t I special” O’hara probably was going to give him two weeks notice and expect him to walk away empty handed. If he could get his hands on that console, he could get to the Game code. Do this right and he could set himself up for life.

In the quarter following the RIND meeting Con|Int’s projections proved to be, if anything, far too conservative. Claire was deep into Level Four on the Game and not paying as much attention to the press as she would have before, back when she had something to sell. In November, she had given the Posse three months leave at half salary to play the Game and think up an new business plan.

This year’s Black Friday, the Friday after Thanksgiving, was a class five disaster: sales at major retailers were down 35 percent from the past year. The flood of red ink had tanked the Dow as well. The after-holiday sales were pathetic, sending a score of regional chains into bankruptcy. The higher value brands were the hardest hit, and the new year found last year’s high-fashion clothing being sold by street vendors in SoHo at a price not much higher than their manufacturing cost in Shenzhen.

 Claire had scheduled a face-to-face meeting with the Posse in a lodge outside of Santa Fe in the week after Mardi Gras. She needed Betsy’s full attention. The company’s situation would be resolved there, one way or the other. By March they might just call it quits and open up a coffee house somewhere.

Claire would sometimes wander along the now quiet Montana Avenue near her house. Half of its stores were empty and the rest were plastered with signs offering heavy discounts. A small retail oasis remained around the bustling Red Star Coffee outlet. LAwear, a new chain offering union-sewed clothing, did a brisk business. Whole Foods and some of the restaurants were doing very well. Even if they abandon the Now, people have to eat.

The Now was like a jail that fed a serial compulsion in its prisoners. Like a drug, it felt so fantastically wonderful for just an instant. That simple transaction, the swipe of the plastic, stood in for all transactions, fluid or fantasy. Retail as masturbation, she thought. Sounds like a paper at an American Anthropology Association meeting. Claire knew it was the Game that turned its players from the Now. Not on purpose, despite Harold Farmer’s warning.

The Now lived on the void that surrounded it, fed on the emptiness it created in people’s lives. The Game came along and filled this void with other transactions. Even Farmer had no idea how fragile the Now was.

The intellectual elitist in her made Claire want to say that the Game released its players from accepting the arbitrary prices that brands required to make the money to buy the advertising to power the brand. Two dollars worth of denim were just that, no matter what the label said. Gamers figured this out. Prices no longer just stuck when producers floated them. She was convinced that a new fashion aesthetic would emerge to replace brand-based consumption.

The low consumer numbers right now, she figured, had to include the fact so many people were playing the Game instead of spending their time and money elsewhere. Once people burned out on the Game, they would be back watching extreme mud wrestling again, or whatever. Only would they? Again she wondered who was behind the Game.

Once the morning rush was over, Desi made his way down to the compound. He made a habit of rotating through the stalls, not picking a favorite. Since he had completed Level Seven, his interactions within the compound became enveloped in a web of deference. He had become not just famous, but revered in a manner reserved for the old and the wise. He felt neither old nor wise, and so the situation was mainly awkward. He spent more and more time in his apartment above the restaurant in Hoi An.

Fortunately, his programming crews no longer required his everyday attention. They had become world-class geeks. Several of them had developed products in their spare time that showed real market potential. Although they were bound by a five-year contract, Desi argued with Winston and Jack to get them permission to pursue these interests through a start-up company in the compound. Sao Do Enterprises handled the patent process and developed prototypes for the marketplace.

Desi exchanged formal greetings with the stall owner and another gentleman, the father of a programmer who was reading his newspaper at the same table. The waiter set down a plate with brioche and another of fruit. He bowed deeply and retreated. Coffee appeared. Desi requested that they turn up the radio they had quieted on his arrival.

His Vietnamese had improved of late. He enjoyed the language with its tonal lilt, but he had little time to polish his skills. He sometimes worried that his DocDo program was making people lazy. They had ported the Junana client to cell phones via WiFi, enabling real-time cross-language conversations. Over in Hoi An he’d seen tourists bargaining with shopkeepers, each of them talking into their cell phones while standing face-to-face. Is nobody learning a second language anymore?

Level Six in the game hinted at a layer of templates undergirding the ones they were unfolding. Desi was now able to map how several template structures that were entirely experiential were also linked through a skein of relations that were too subtle for direct experience. From his linguistics background he was wary of designing formal structures for these relations. He was content to note how their presence could be mapped by their effects on those templates one could directly experience.

The template “Fractal Layer Underneath” was a good example of how experience was informed by the qualities of its edges, rather than its center. This template suggested that those designs which contain details at three spatial levels and include a level too small to be experienced without magnification were visually pleasing over long periods of time.

Fractal Layer Underneath resolved the problem of why experiences of the natural world, where fractal surfaces were abundant, were often more satisfying than human designs: why a bouquet of flowers was generally more pleasing than a photograph of these. It also explained why film, with its grain, was more pleasing than digital photographs without grain. This template revealed the appeal of various forms of art and architecture from abstract expressionism to mannerism. It resolved how the “Simple on the Outside” template could apply to an abstract expressionist painting by Mark Tobey and why many modernist buildings do not sustain visual interest over time.

Desi finished breakfast and looked at his watch. A team meeting was scheduled for 10:30. He had time for a hike along the river before his day officially began.

Claire’s daughter Megan had spent the previous night in Claire’s bed, inconsolable—not merely unhappy but flat out miserable. She had flung her arms around her mother’s neck, clutching at Claire’s back while Claire consoled her with caresses. Megan spoke of her torment, her words garbled by her sobs. Megan’s Guide in the Game had died.

Bobby had told her he was not going to be with her in Level Five.

“I thought he was just testing me, challenging me to think on my own.” She buried her face in Claire’s neck. “We were taking our ride, down on the beach, Bobby on his black horse and me on my palomino. He just fell sideways on the sand and lay there, not moving. I ran to him and he was breathing heavy. He said that it was time for him to go on to another place and that I must not be sad. But I am sad!”

“I can’t help it,” she blubbered. “Bobby!”

“‘You will always be my little warrior,’ he told me, and then he touched my face. “I will live in your memories of our time together.’ Then he closed his eyes forever.

“I sat there for, I don’t know, hours. How could he die? And then, from out of the heavens, silhouetted by the sun, two avatars in bright silver armor and enormous feathery wings swooped down and landed nearby. The visors on their silver helmets were up and their faces were solemn. They walked up to Bobby’s body and picked this up between them. One of them looked at me and he bowed his head. They rose on their wings, turned into the sun and climbed until I couldn’t see them anymore. If only I’d taken more time on Level Four, he’d be alive right now. He pushed me ahead in the Game, knowing it would kill him.”

Claire stroked the damp hair away from Megan’s cheek. “He was a magnificent Guide and a true friend.”

“Mumlie. Why did he have to die? Why?”

Claire held her close for some time before she spoke.

“Meggie, Bobby is a Game piece,” Claire said. “I know you loved being with him, and loved what he did to help you in the Game. My Guide was very special to me. When Fuzango died I felt terrible.”

Claire’s Guide, Fuzango he called himself, was ancient, sinewy and plastered with ashes. He first greeted her in Jagahala and then switched to English. Almost comically gruff, he ordered her around like she was his slave. He was dressed as a village elder on a festival day, meaning he was naked except for this koteka penis sheath, held vertically with twine around his waist, and an elaborate headdress of feathers and fur.

When she had been a young female anthropologist in the field, she never could get the tribal elders to pay her proper attention. Old Fuzango told her things about Highland New Guinea culture that she wished she’d learned for her dissertation—that is, when he wasn’t pushing her in front of a train. He died in his hut after giving her the first smile he ever showed.

“Bobby would not have died if he didn’t think you were ready for the next level. He was a good friend and dying was his way of helping you move on.”

Megan was quiet then, sobbing into Claire’s shoulder as they lay on the bed. Claire understood the death of the Guide as a rite of passage the Game had determined was valuable for the process of moving ahead. While a part of her might have cursed the Game programmers for her daughter’s sadness, a larger part welcomed Bobby’s passing. How could Claire ever compete with Mr. Wonderful: the all-knowing, all-feeling, positively cute, Bobby?

Bobby’s death brought Megan into her arms. It had been years since Megan called her ‘Mumlie,’ almost as long since they had something really important to share. Claire held her daughter until Megan’s breathing quieted into sleep.

Itchy and Desi reclined in the Cordobaloungers, mesmerized by the firelight.

“How did you program the logs to actually burn down?”

“It’s a non-linear process.”

“You mean?”

“Logarithmically, my dear Lucy.”

“Complex algorithm?”

“That too.” Itchy sat up. “I’m a bit worried.”

Desi turned his attention to his friend.

“There’s a lot of unaccounted for noise in the system,” Itchy said. He had a standing task to optimize the Guide functions. The Guide subroutine had become a monumental programming effort and by some measures the singular hallmark of the Game. It was extravagant in terms of computing power. More than half of the Game’s petaflops went to support Guide interactions.

“Is it just noise?” Desi asked. “I have reports that the Guides are talking to each other.”

“Curious.” Itchy nodded slowly.

“By ‘Curious?’, do you mean ‘interesting’ or ‘holy fucking shit!’?”

“Very, very interesting. We needed to have the Guides share their learned behaviors. We could never keep up programming them individually.”

“So if any one Guide learns a new trick, they all learn it?”

“That’s the idea.”

“All billion of them?”

Itchy was still nodding slowly.

“What if a player asks a Guide to contact a Guide of another player?”

“The Guides were programmed to talk to their own players. They cannot talk with any other player.”

“If their player asks them to learn a new trick, like talking to another Guide, could they learn it?”

“Guides are programmed to be helpful. If they cannot do a task, they are programmed to deflect the request by encouraging the user to focus on the Game.”

“How does a Guide know they can’t do a task?”

“They query the common pool and get a result. If there is no corresponding behavior, then they can spend a certain amount of cycles attempting to approximate the behavior. At the end of that time, they basically give up.”

“What happens to these cycles?”

“The failed ones?”

“Right.”

“They go into the pool as well, so that the next attempt can start where the previous one ended.”

“So they learn from each other’s mistakes.”

“That’s the plan.”

“How smart can they get?”

“You mean, can they achieve sentience and take over the world?”

“Something like that.”

“Not as long as we control the Guide subroutine. There is no return path between this subroutine and the main admin routines, just a one-way instruction link. We can simply turn them off any time we want to. What we can’t do is predict precisely what they will learn within the boundaries of their programming. Yes, I would say that, over time, Guides could learn to talk with each other. I’m just not sure what they would have to talk about.”

“Does Scratchy know about this?”

“We should probably discuss it next time we are all in the Room. Right now, I’m just concerned that the Guide subroutine will swamp the whole Game. Even on the mesh, they are hogging a lot of RAM.”

“If they are talking to each other, it might be a good idea to figure out what they are saying,” Desi mused. “Before they start voting.”

Like most plans where you are trying to screw your boss, Don’s would either work or get him fired or both. As sysadmin Don had ROOT privileges on Junana. This gave him direct access to the Junana databases, including email account fields. Other users’ passwords, however, were encrypted even in the database.

His plan was simple. He would log into the Junana database as ROOT. He would send out an email to all five players, a simple suggestion that they routinely change their password. He’d make it appear to be a standard email to all Junana players. He would intercept all requests for new passwords and copy these to another file.

Most geeks who work on security measures imagine how improbable it would be for someone to take the time and effort required to break these. They fail to understand that the people who hack security systems do this for a living. And no system is really secure from an inside attack.

Don broadcast the email with the subject “Junana security alert, please change password regularly.” The email came from the Junana system, and for all they knew it went out to all billion or so members, when it actually just went to the five players with access to that room. The body of the email said that best practice was to change passwords every ninety days and gave them the age of their current password. Then he waited.

Thirty minutes later, his code captured a password reset reply email from one of the five, a ‘bobbyjones1930’. He wrote down the password and trashed his code and the file. Then he hesitated. Whoever sent this was still at their computer. He checked the clock, it was around three in the afternoon. Not knowing where in the world this user might be, he figured if he waited ten hours he would be safer. They would either be off work by then or even asleep.

At 1:00 a.m., Don logged in to Junana with the username ‘bobbyjones1930’ and the new password. Don stepped into the goth scene transporter and found himself in the Room. He was alone. He located the console and moved to it, praying this needed no additional password. He stretched his invisible hands out over the keyboard. Junana sent the system the message that his avatar was in ‘keyboard mode’, which meant that what he typed on his keyboard was being entered in a keyboard in Junana.

Don knew what he was looking for. From here he could access all the privileges of every player, including Scratchy O’hara. He pulled up the account for bobbyjones1930 and noticed that this had several fields he did not recognize from the ROOT level. One of them was called ‘Room,” and it was set to ‘Yes.’ Don noticed an icon for Eclipse. He clicked this and the development environment opened up in front of his eyes. He scanned the menus.

“Holy Shit!” he whispered. There were hundreds of folders. Enough source code to run, well, the whole show.

One of the features of an integrated development environment is the ability to back-up the latest version of the source files, one at a time, or, as a batch when needed. Don moused up the file back-up menu, clicked “entire package” and “zip and email back-up” options, selected one of his own email addresses as the destination, and pushed “Send.”

A folder with millions of lines of code is smaller than a single, short movie clip. The process was completed in less than a minute. If Don was a dancing man, he’d be doing a jig in his chair. Instead he saw visions of banknotes and Swiss accounts. So many, many zeros.

Don heard a voice and nearly jumped out of his chair. He turned around, and his office door was still closed and locked.

He turned the head on his avatar and saw two other avatars in the Room. They were coming toward the console. He quickly switched off ‘keyboard mode’ and moved his avatar sideways as the one named Itchy walked up and stopped right where he had been standing an instant before. Lucky he had set the avatar’s visibility to zero. On the console, the IDE program was still open but the console was now ready for a new user.

“Now that we’ve settled on the London club design, do you think we can talk Scratchy out of these tacky lounge chairs?” the one they called Desi said. He walked straight into Don’s avatar and rebounded.

“Fuck,” Don muttered, he had forgotten to turn off the collision detection and also his microphone.

“Well, excuse me!” Desi said, turning back to face Itchy.

“Fuck yourself,” Itchy said without looking around. He opened up a file on the console. “Looks like they committed the new code for Castalia.”

Don logged out and the room disappeared. He sat at his computer in a cold sweat and stared at his desktop on the monitor for several minutes until the screen saver kicked on. He opened up his email client and pushed the “Get Mail” button. The cursor spun for a good minute and then a new email popped up.

There it was. Top of the Inbox list. A four-hundred and ninety megabyte zip file named JNA0111. He burned this to a disk and also copied it to a USB thumbdrive. Unless they used more than one development environment set up, he had stolen the entire source code for the Junana social network and the Game.

Now he had something to sell. He would need to find a buyer. Not just any buyer, someone with more money than Don could imagine, and Don had a fairly expansive imagination in this area.
