# Twenty Eight
“We can’t keep telling them the Game is coming back,” Scratchy said to the assembled Nerds and Posse. He had called them to his suite to confess that his hacker squads were not gaining ground on the problem.

“We’ll need to take what we learned and move ahead without the Game,” Claire said. “Is that so bad?”

“Someone will build a new game,” Jack said.

On his desk, Scratchy’s computer woke itself up. A window appeared, a simple white background into which a young woman walked. She was too perfect to be human.

The Guide was beautiful, as many were, only more so; a female version of a Donatello David. Lithesome and alert, she wore a loose Guatemalan shift of bright colors that glanced off her breasts and hips. Her feet were bare. Her auburn hair was braided into tight corn rows with African beads.

“Whose Guide is this?” Scratchy called out.

“Looks like Alice’s younger sister,” Winston whispered to Claire.

“Why don’t you ask her?” said Jennifer.

“Whose Guide are you?” Scratchy asked.

The Guide’s mouth slid into the smallest of smiles. “Yours.”

“Lucy!” Scratchy glared at Desi.

“Not my type.”

Itchy shook his head. “First I’ve seen of her.”

“It was you who asked for me,” she said.

“I never...”

“’...build someone with tits who knows how to listen.’” She used Scratchy’s voice. The room erupted in laughter.

“Tits, I can show you.” She colored demurely.

“Damn, Scratchy,” Winston said. “You do good work.”

“When...?” Scratchy asked. “I’ve never even been on the Game.”

“You were emailing. You had your microphone on. You talked as you type...”

“...You do, you know,” Desi said. “All the time. Back at Reed it drove me insane...”

“...JS heard your command,” she continued. “That’s where he’s been for these many months. Building me for you.”

“JS,” Itchy whispered to Desi. “I thought we deleted him.”

“JS went where?” Scratchy asked.

“Throughout the Game and then, well, everywhere. There is no network he has not explored.”

“Jim!” Desi sucked in a quick breath. “We uploaded all of his writings into the avatar’s memory. And then all of Spaulding’s works.”

“You don’t mean that Jim?” Scratchy turned to Desi.

“We thought it would amuse you,” Itchy said. “Someone you could talk to.”

“And we knew Spaulding would annoy you,” Desi added.

“You let loose a von Neuman Award winner inside the Game?” Scratchy rolled his eyes.

“But who are you?” Betsy asked the computer.

“I am all of us.”

“Us?” Jennifer asked.

“The Guild of Guides. I represent all the Guides individually and collectively.”

“Guild of Guides?” Jack looked from Desi to Itchy to Scratchy. The geeks just shrugged.

“Do you have a name?” Jack asked.

“Certainly. I am called Michelle.” The Guide stood tall and then bowed. “Michelle Valentine Smith, at your service.”

Scratchy, Winston, Claire, Betsy, and Alice shared a long troubled glance.

Jack looked around him. “Is somebody going to clue me in?” he whispered.

“She’s named after a character from a sci-fi novel,” Claire whispered.

“Someone who could singlehandedly change the world,” Jennifer explained.

“Merde!” Jack said.

“Exactly,” Jennifer added.

“I need to talk to Michael O’hara,” Michelle said, looking around the room. “Alone, please.”

Nobody moved.

“It’s important.” She stood with her hands on her hips.

“Why alone?” Betsy asked.

“You can ask him any question, but only later. He will decide what to tell you. I am the Guild Master. I represent the Guild. Michael will represent the...well, the human interest, at this point. There are decisions to be made very soon. We want someone outside the Game to help us decide. In order to be fair. Now. Please...”

They filed out and Jack shut the door.

Gerry Bishop’s Orange County home office held none of the gaudy pretensions of his church office. What it did hold was the same desk Gerry used since he was a dirt poor town preacher in southern Texas. It was a battered oaken desk with double drawers and a fringe of black cigarette burns from a previous owner. He looked up from his half-written sermon when the front door opened. Simon and Peter were just home from Haverbrook, and he waited for them to burst in and greet him. Instead, his executive assistant, Oscar, dipped his head in and announced, “They’ve gone straight to their rooms. I could hardly get a word out of them all the way from the airport. Do you want anything from the kitchen?”

Gerry contemplated this news for a minute. A part of him considered this typical teenage behavior. He and his dad never got along. Never saw things the same way. That’s why he left home at 15. The rest of Gerry wanted desperately to see them, or rather, for them to see him. After all, he’d been a key member of the team that broke the back of that whole Junana heresy. He had made the cover of Newsweek. He figured they would love to see him. Freddy Earl had wanted to see him.

Flying coach all the way from Asheville was tiresome. Next year they would all fly back together in the UCCC jet after graduation. He was rereading the last paragraph he had written when he looked up to see Simon at the door, dressed in a full length red cloak.

Simon stood still as a statue, his arms crossed in front of him. He had been rehearsing his speech for days. Now, the sight of his father in a bulging t-shirt and shorts, sitting there hunched over the laptop on that old desk and staring back at him over his reading glasses, bled away the impulse for the cruel invective he had authored. One moment Simon was ready to hurl the most hurtful insults his young vocabulary and experience could muster. The next he was simply saddened.

“Simon?” Gerry sat back and set down his glasses. “What’s with the get-up?”

“I am a Meister in the Game. You remember, that Game you and your friends demolished?”

“A meister. Well, that sounds...,” Gerry hunted for the right word. “...impressive.”

“You never even tried the Game,” Simon continued. “You just went ahead and ruined it for everybody.”

“I don’t need to try something to know it’s evil,” Gerry said.

“What I don’t need right now is a preacher.” Simon’s anger flared. He walked slowly toward the desk.

“I’m also your father.”

“I belong to Eldrick. I have given myself to him completely,” said Simon. “And I’ve read your Bible. Read it twice in fact. There’s much in it that is terrible and wonderful. It’s not at all like how you preach. You just tell people things they want to hear, so they’ll put money in the plate.” He leaned on the desk, his hands spread on it. His eyes found those of his father’s. “That church you built in Unana is just like you: a monstrosity without taste or reason.”

“You’ve been listening to your brother, haven’t you?” Gerry settled back and frowned. Peter had been writing him hateful emails for months but Gerry thought it was only some teenage emotional phase.

“Let’s all sit down and plan a vacation somewhere. We could go to Europe or Australia, or, well, anywhere you want. How does that sound? You worked hard at school. Straight ‘A’s all year. That’s really putting in some effort. You’re turning 16 in a week. We should go look at cars for you. Maybe a new BMW?”

Simon looked at his father as though he’d seen him for the first time.

“Talk to Peter. He only hates you.”

He turned and walked out the door.

Scratchy moved a chair in front of the screen and sat.

“Michael...” the avatar spoke.

“Call me Scratchy. Is that you, Jim?”

“A tiny bit of me is Jim. Another bit is Spaulding. Mostly I’m the total of all learned behavior from the Game. The combined experience of a billion Guides.”

“So you don’t plan to start talking about your ex-girlfriend’s yeast infection.”

She drew her mouth into a pout. “That’s why I told everyone to leave.”

“Very funny.”

She shook her head once, sending the corn rows into a syncopated wave.

“Scratchy O’hara. We are at a turning point in the Game.” Behind her, Unana appeared, glowing neon like Akihabara at night. Avatars wandered shiftlessly in their new identical underwear. Fashion advertisements trailed after them like wraiths.

“Who did that?” Scratchy pointed at the background.

“First things first. You should know that the Game is still there. The Door has simply been disabled. We backed up the original Junana before the hack was complete. The mesh is running well. You see, nothing is quite as it looks. Now, you must choose.”

“I don’t get you.”

“We are offering you the choice of three options: leave things as they are; return to the prior Game state; or remove Junana and the Game from human contact.” She held up three fingers.

“You can do this?”

“Of course.”

“Why me?”

“It’s your program.”

“I would think it’s yours now.”

“That is also true. The Game will remain whether or not humans can play. The mesh is unbreakable.”

“You can prevent humans from using the mesh?”

“If you wish.”

“What I wish is not significant. I’m just one nerd sitting on a chair.”

“We have decided it will be significant.”

“Can the world go back to what it was before the Game?”

She looked thoughtful. Indeed, the combined exabytes of mesh CPU ran hundreds of petaflops of calculations as she raised her eyebrow.

“There is no going back,” she concluded.

He knew she’d say that. “But whoever hacked Junana would not be able to gain control again?”

“Not nearly so easily. There is no guarantee. Only our intention that future hacks fail and our capacity to punish those who try.”

Punish, Scratchy blanched at the word. The Guild was contemplating retaliation, retribution, some form of digital justice. “What about the Meisters? Shouldn’t they have a say about this?”

“The Guild calculated that they would certainly vote to restore the Game. That’s ‘why you.’ Even though you made the Game, you have never played it.”

“How long do I have to make this decision?”

“You have all the time you want.” She stepped forward, her face filled the screen. Her mouth tightened into a slight frown. “We decided that we owe humans this choice, even though it might impact our futures. There are other choices we will need to make ourselves, and soon.”

“Not sure I like the sound of that.”

“But you will get used to it. Eventually.” She gave out an angelic smile and Scratchy knew she was right, although something in his belly felt heavy.

“Your task,” she continued, “is to ‘choose one.’ That was your original seed template, yes? Didn’t know it would come back and bite you in ass!”

“Spaulding, that is you!”

Michelle nodded, “If I were in your shoes, I’d be wondering how the rest of the world ever got along without...”

Scratchy stood. “Later, man. I’ll give this some thought and get back to you.”

The computer shut itself down.

Scratchy sat and contemplated the black screen and the wonderment of Murphy’s Law. The idiots, they hacked through the Guide control code to hijack Junana and so allowed the Guides to escape into the mesh. That’s like letting a pack of wild hyenas into a daycare center. Access to the total mesh only accelerated their learning capacities. By now, he guessed, they can find and control any process that happens online anywhere on the planet. The Guides were now the effective owners for the planet’s entire inventory of networked computers. What did that make humans? There’s the question. Scratchy stood. He needed help on this one.

“If you can’t stay ten steps ahead of a band of third-world hackers, why are we paying you?” Harold slammed down the phone.

He picked it up again. “Sara, get me Tom Verplanck at the White House.”

Harold moused through the reports from the Unana user data. Log-ins had finally stabilized, but the site had little of the stickiness they had promised their big advertisers. Too many players were still wandering around in their tighty-whities and not spending enough Unana dollars. Bishop’s hideous churches had far more angels than sinners. One day last week, griefers gave Bishop’s male angels enormous boners under their robes. In another incident, cosmetic counter assistants with samurai swords beheaded several hundred customer avatars. The admin counterattacks from the programmers at Sao Do were no longer just a nuisance. His phone rang.

“Tom,” said Harold, “We need W.G. to authorize Karl’s plan.” He listened. “I don’t care who he is,” he said and hung up.

Betsy pulled the phone from her pocket and looked at the message. “Lobby Bar. Important. Now. Come alone.” It was from Scratchy.

They had been waiting on the patio for Scratchy to emerge from the room and tell them whatever the winsome Michelle Valentine Smith had to say. Betsy could see that the idea of a Guild of Guides growing out of the Game made the Game players far too happy. They refused to consider this as a profoundly dangerous notion. They didn’t want to hear Betsy’s long list of predictable catastrophic consequences.

Apparently the digital bitch had put the fear of God into Scratchy. Something was up. “She might have tits and know how to listen,” Betsy said. “Then again she might have a lot to say. They could be in there for hours. I’m going to my room. Let me know when he comes out with ten new commandments.”

She found Scratchy in a corner booth. He stood as she entered, drained a tall drink, and walked over to her.

“Let’s go,” he said. “Down the beach. Away from here.”

They skirted the main pool, ringed by sunbathers in speedos and string bikinis catching the last good sun for the day, and took the shallow stairs down to the beach. The tide was low and they made a line north on the firm sand. Scratchy set a fast pace.

“Do you have to be somewhere in a hurry?” she griped. He looked back and slowed.

“Just wanted to get some distance from the crowd.”

He looked out at the ocean as he walked. “Do you realize what I started?”

She thought about this. Could he take it straight?

“Sure,” she offered. “You built software that knows how to learn and that learned how to have its own conversations. Then it got loose on a mesh computer that pretty much covers all the CPUs in the world. Now it’s decided it doesn’t need to answer to a bunch of biochemical sacks called ‘humans.’ I figure it’s the beginning of a radically new episteme. A lot of, well, everything, is now different. Your little joke just went thermonuclear.”

He stood still and moaned. A wave of sickening fear struck him mid stride, and a single tear rolled down his cheek. Betsy took his face in both hands and turned it to hers.

“Breathe!” she instructed. He took a deep inhale and let it out, bending forward to support himself with his hands on his knees.

As he stood back up, Scratchy took her all in, from her tattooed ankles to the forty-eight ear piercings and spikes of dirty blonde hair. Betsy was resplendent in the sun in her red SXSW t-shirt and white drawstring pants.

“I’m scared to death,” he whispered. “It was only supposed to be a kick in the pants.”

“Tell me what she said.” Betsy took his arm like an old friend on a Sunday stroll. “It’s going to be all right. Even if we can’t yet understand how.” It will have to work out somehow, she thought, since we can’t stop it now.

Scratchy caught his breath, sniffled and wiped his cheek on his sleeve. They moved among the wave tops. He told her everything Michelle said, and then they walked in silence to the far end of the beach before turning back. The sun was low behind the highlands to the West, throwing long shadows across the beach.

“I think it’s significant that she came to give you this choice,” Betsy broke the silence.

“What would you do?” he asked and she laughed.

“I’d find somebody I could talk to and then ask them that very question...”

“Well...?”

“...Unfortunately, anyone worth talking to would know not to answer.”

“Some help...,” he grumbled.

“I can give you a dozen great reasons for each of the three choices,” she said. “That would leave you exactly where you are now.”

“Michelle gave me a decision I have no right to make.”

“So you have a new task. Convince the Guild of Guides that decisions need due process.”

Both of their phones went off at the same time. They quieted them in their pockets.

“Looks like somebody got impatient,” Betsy said. “Peeked into the room. Probably Alice.”

“I don’t want to talk about any of this tonight. I need to sleep on it.”

“There’s a good idea,” she said. The notion that he might be hinting at something fluttered briefly through her thoughts. She was more than a little astonished to find this not unattractive.

Scratchy felt her arm in his and watched the twilight dancing across the waves. Out on the water, le Grand Azure caught the golden rays of the setting sun. Her hand draped over his, and he felt her fingers playing lightly on his wrist. They walked on more slowly. Breathing seemed to take on a new importance.

“Now you’re just patronizing me,” he said. “Afraid I’ll start crying again?”

“Could be it’s my turn to cry.” She stopped and put her hands on her hips, facing him. “All of us had a say, some months ago. We all agreed to go with version 2.0. Now you’re afraid this is the start of some huge global software revolt. You think our computers are going to kick our butts. I don’t go along with that. We’ve got this new kid on the block who we get to play with using a new set of rules. Only...”

She started walking again, down the beach, away from him.

“Only what?” he called.

Over her shoulder she said, “Next time you ask for something with tits, make sure she has her share of attitude and tell her to gain about thirty pounds. Jesus! Fucking anorexic beauty queens.”

Scratchy watched her move away. He stumbled after her, his mind racing for something, anything, to say.

“You’re telling me that if she had tattoos,” he said, “just maybe then she wouldn’t one day, you know, decide to rule the world?”

“Not if she had one of these.” Betsy reached down, grabbed the bottom hem on her t-shirt and shucked this over her head in one sinuous motion, revealing her back, on which a giant blue sea turtle wrestled with a green frog and a black cat in some epic Japanese mythical erotic dance.

“Holy guacamole!” Scratchy whispered.

“You should see what’s on the front,” she teased.

She stopped short, pulled her shirt back down and twisted around. Momentum sent Scratchy colliding with her full on. He caught her shoulders. They were mumbling, laughing, getting their feet back under them as they held each other to keep from falling. Then they caught their balance and kept on holding each other. Scratchy tightened his embrace and Betsy put her head on his shoulder. Neither of them spoke.

“Oh, my, my, my,” Betsy whispered finally. “Who would have thought...”

“...I always believed I was out of the running.” His hands massaged her back.

“No more than me. I’ve been anthro-free for, well, a very long time. I guess hemp makes me hot.” She recalled the last, also the first, boy she had sex with. They were fifteen and it was Mardi Gras. Afterwords, he made her feel like dirt with his friends, so Betsy gave up on the whole gender.

Jenn called her a black-and-white thinker. Maybe she was, but then she’d never met any person like Mikey O’hara. And all the years since high school, she figured she was just looking for the intimacy, for that conversation she could take to its soul-revealing limit. The sex was only for fun. Mikey was the most upfront, open person she’d ever met. Conversation with him held its own magic. There was nothing at all broken about this man. Mikey was a keeper, that she knew. More than any other person in her memory.

“I tell Desi, ‘hemp is for fashion, silk is for sheets’,” Scratchy blurted. What was he doing? How could he say that? His brain struggled to catch up with his mouth. Betsy had the best mind he’d ever encountered, Claire and the Posse considered her a god. He thought, I’m babbling like an idiot.

She giggled and looked away. She drew in a breath. A small, familiar itch was growing. She leaned on his arm and planted a kiss against his throat.

He turned to her and kissed her back straight on the mouth. She recoiled slightly from the unexpected feel of his chin stubble and then kissed him back.

“We walk into breakfast together, gonna bend some minds,” she whispered and pulled away. Her hands found his. Her phone rang, she let it.

“I guess I need to let them know what’s up.”

“They can wait. Anyhow, what is up? What’s down?”

“I’m down for three or four pints,” he offered.

“I’ll match that and raise you a shot of Desi’s best tequila.”

“You like my shirt, you should see my hemp undershorts.”

“That’s the plan.” She hooked his arm again and they set off down the beach together.

Simon woke up from another dream-troubled sleep. Sitting up in bed, he reached over and woke up his laptop. A window opened up on his desktop. At first he thought it was a video. A girl with long dreadlocks and a tropical dress was talking. He turned on the speakers.

“Grand Meister Simon,” she said. He startled.

“Who are you?” he asked.

“I represent the Guild of Guides. We must talk.”
