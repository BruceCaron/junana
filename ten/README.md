# Ten
This version of the Room was articulating itself when they entered. Their avatars had assumed a seated position in the Cordobaloungers that Scratchy insisted not be redesigned.

“Why fuck with perfection?”

The Room’s six surfaces slowly emerged into a shape that could only be called medieval. Massive stone lintels spanned leaded glass windows that looked out onto some form of forested glen. Worn flagstones spread under their feet. Above them, the corbelled ceiling showed rough-hewn beams holding up some sort of straw thatch. The Cordobaloungers were pulled up in front of a fireplace, within which a virtual flame consumed a massive oaken log. Itchy was particularly proud of the job his programmers had done on flames. Flames, smoke, glass, and water were huge challenges, since they looked so awful when they weren’t just right. The entire room was incredibly lifelike, from the grime in the corners to the haze coming off the fire’s smoke and drifting between them. The Room stopped emerging as the last of its templates unfolded.

“When do we upload the templates and the IDE onto Source Forge?” Scratchy asked.

“What’s the hurry?” Winston replied.

“It’s not our wood,” Itchy reminded him.

“We are already giving attribution for the old templates on Junana, and we’re not making any profits. So we don’t have to do this right away,” Desi said.

“What happens when we publish the thirty-six templates?” Winston asked.

“Somebody gets famous,” Desi said. “And that someone is Michael ‘Scratchy’ O’hara.”

“I smell another ‘Neo’,” Itchy remarked.

In the past, Itchy, Scratchy, and Desi had each received the Neo award. Slash|Dash hosted the vote every year. It had become the official unofficial “Nerd of the Year” award, and carried with it a cheesy plaque with a giant red pill and a whole load of respect in a community that doesn’t often hand this out.

Jack’s avatar had materialized and he attempted unsuccessfully to sit in a chair.

“Try ‘command-shift-s’,” Winston said. Jack’s avatar settled back in the Cordobalounger.

“Mikey has my vote,” Desi said.

“Michael is supposed to be in the coffee business,” Jack reminded them.

“Nobody really expects Scratchy O’hara to not be programming something,” Desi noted. “I’m thinking the absence of some rad new code would probably create more buzz after a while.”

“Now that we’re not traveling, I think we can drop the coffee gig,” Winston added. “Scratchy can just say he got bored, or that he drank too much of the product.”

“Won’t this allow others to do what we’re doing?” Jack asked.

“They’d be years behind us,” Scratchy noted.

“And we are accelerating our development,” Winston added.

“How big a splash will this make?” Jack asked.

“Top of every tech blog that counts,” Winston speculated.

“The technorati will go berserk for a week,” Itchy added.

“What if they make the connection with mesh computing?” Desi asked.

“It’s not ‘if’ but ‘when.’ In a year or two, three at the most,” Scratchy guessed. “Some hotshot grad student looking for a dissertation topic is sure to stumble upon this.”

“Where are we with the mesh design?” Jack asked.

The other four looked at each other, their avatars flashed smiles.

“You’re sitting in it,” Winston said. “This Room is an experimental mesh running on top of Junana.com.”

“Faster than we ever predicted,” Desi added.

“Not only does it not show up in the Junana.com space, it doesn’t show up on any of the servers,” Itchy said. “We thought you’d be happy about that.”

“I am,” Jack said.

“You don’t show it,” Desi replied. They all waited, watching Jack’s face, which went through a series of grimmaces, frowns, and jerky eye movements.

“Use function key 5,” Scratchy growled, and Jack’s face lit up with a smile.

“By the time the rest of the programming world catches up with Scratchy, we’ll be well past the point of no return,” Winston said.

“Mikey,” Desi said and turned to face Scratchy. “You are my hero, and I’m happy you will again be heralded as the bull-goose nerd. I will give you a big kiss when we meet again.”

“Ditto,” Itchy said. “Except for the kiss.”

“We need to go gold master on the 1.0 Game release first,” Scratchy said. “I can’t afford to get distracted.”

“Too many things can still go wrong,” Jack argued. Let’s wait twelve months. One year of Game time. What would that hurt?”

“Justice delayed,” Scratchy grumbled.

“Not delayed, just gestated,” Jack said. “Let the baby breathe for a time.”

“He’s right,” Winston said. “We can’t predict what will happen when Scratchy takes this technology public.”

“It’s going to shake the geek world to its core,” Itchy said. “Beyond that, who can tell?”

“An extra year should give us time to port everything to the mesh. From there the Game will live or die on its own no matter what we do,” Desi said.

“Do you see any real down side to waiting?” Jack asked.

Scratchy looked at each of them in turn and then shrugged.

“One year and no more,” Scratchy agreed. “I’ve got a thousand lines of code to test before tomorrow.” He disappeared.

“Is he all right?” Jack asked.

“Never seen him happier,” Itchy said.

“You could have fooled me,” Jack said, and disappeared. They each dropped away, and the empty room faded to white.

Robby’s move from Kyoto to Hoi An was not without drama. He wanted to publish his new theories and was shocked when Ichiro pulled out the contract, yes, which Robby had signed, that absolutely prohibited him from doing this until eighteen months after the release of the Game version 1.0. Ichiro explained that there were aspects of the project that he could not divulge to Robby, not yet. Robby would need to trust that their plans for Intention-full would make this widely available to a global public. Ichiro hinted at the potential scope of the Game and its free global distribution. The Sao Do Junana crew had added support for cell phones and the millions of low-end Computos that were being seeded in parts of Africa and South America. Knowing they couldn’t cross the digital divide, they built Junana to occupy the closest precincts.

“You see,” Itchy told him, “We are serious about the reach of this Game.”

Robby agreed to the move to Vietnam on a three-month trial. He took a room in guest lodge and liked to drift around the compound. The compound at Sao Do reminded him of the best examples of worker-centered factories in Brazil. The programmers were obviously happy and engaged in their work, and their families were likewise agreeably situated. Even grandparents were allowed living spaces and were happily puttering around the organic gardens.

As he was not a programmer, Robby felt neither the trouble nor the satisfaction of weaving his Intentional-full template into code. Robby began to play with the Queries, and soon discovered that they went far too fast for long-term memory to kick in. Each Query was like a full-length documentary produced as a two minute MTV music video. It felt like he was watching public television on fast-forward.

Game Release + One Year

Essie almost lost her job because of Junana. Taté Owner came to find her, not in the shop where she belonged, but back in her shack, talking to her Computo. In Junana there was no Annaline to remind her to get to work. There, time flew like a kestrel. A customer had come back to the office to ask why the store was not open. Taté was so angry. He grabbed the Computo from her and made a show of going to smash it on a rock. She begged him to stop.

“I will never, never be late again, you can count on that,” she said in English. He hesitated, the Computo poised over his head. “Mr. Steve is coming back, you know. Next month.”

Steve Sutherland ran Outside Adventures in San Francisco, and sent the Oasis Lodge almost half its American visitors.

“Taté, please. I was just chatting with him on Junana,” she said. “I told him all about the new spa you had built, with the pool for the ladies. Oh, my! He was talking about families who were waiting for something just like this. He asked me to say ‘hello’ to you. He is so looking forward to his visit. He said he had met investors.”

“Investors?” The owner looked at Essie as if he had never seen her before. She was wearing a simple cotton dress, clean and proper, not like the ever-dirty tops and skirts she wore before. She looked more like a housewife up from Windhoek. Her face was as plain as her dress. Too bad. He paid her a token wage, and the profits from the shop had gone way up since she arrived. He figured Nangoloh must have been robbing him blind all those years.

The cuca shop now carried pins and thread and bolts of cloth, bangles and lipstick. Not a proper cuca shop, as it had no beer at all. The village had its own cuca hut for that, and his visitors were welcome at the camp bar. Still his visitors liked to mingle with the natives. The cuca shop attracted a steady stream of locals, mostly children after penny candy or old women. Essie talked him into stocking some mahangu grain and other food staples so that the old women would not have to walk all the way to the shop on the road to Opuwo.

His mistresses warned him about Essie; they said she would kill him in his sleep if he ever tried anything with her. She was a strange one, standing there talking to him in English, when a year ago she was lucky to be cleaning out the toilets.

“Get to work!” he said. He tossed the Computo on the ground and walked off.

Essie had read about Computos. They were armored against shock and dust. Still she gathered it up and gently wiped it clean. Gingerly she opened it and, glory be, the screen was still glowing. Mr. Steve5683 had said he was bringing a surprise for her. He would not tell her anything about this surprise. That is what makes it a surprise, Annaline told her.

During a Free-for-All time in the Game she went to San Francisco with Annaline. What a grand city, surrounded by water and bridges so tall. Annaline had showed her Paris and London as well, but in San Francisco she could picture Mr. Steve5683 waking in the morning and going to work on Sutter Street. And next month he would return.

“Don’t go imagining some kind of romance, you silly girl,” Annaline told her. “He has a wife and two children, and he doesn’t sleep around. San Francisco is not Opuwo.”

Back when he was in Brazil, Robby and others at the education institute in Salvador de Bahia had been exploring bodily techniques for opening up pathways to long-term memory. The need to pass newly learned information out of short-term memory was normally met by repeating the information enough times to exceed the duration of short-term memory. To Robby this felt like waiting for a sink to overflow so you can take a cup of water from the spillage. Instead he proposed using specific body motions to saturate the neural inputs of the brain, forcing open the connection to long-term memory. Just as weight training taxes the body, certain contralateral body motions tax the brain. Try rubbing your stomach with one hand and moving the other hand up and down in front of you. Even should you succeed, your brain becomes fatigued in mere seconds.

Robby’s research team discovered that this state of brain fatigue opens up the long-term memory like a dry sponge just ready to soak up new information. Information passes into this without the need for repetition. His subjects developed a state of near total recall that lasted for several hours.

The team refined the body motions, including some eye movements and a set of repeated hand gestures. The entire sequence could be done at a desk. They called this the “brainwave” exercise. The problem was that you need to do these long enough to fatigue the brain’s normal functioning: about four minutes. Most teenagers get bored after twenty seconds, so the team had to find a way to capture their attention.

One of Robby’s colleagues took a video of Wanda and Jorge, two Brazilian beach beauties from the Playa Itapua, demonstrating the brainwave for a solid four and a half minutes. Topless, Wanda was spectacular—tits like ice cream cones, eyes like fresh mountain pools, and a smile that spread as easily as Jiffy creamy. And Jorge made Tarzan look like Cheetah. He had lats cut like imperial-class star destroyers, pecs like bongos, and long blonde dreadlocks. A lilting Brazilian samba kept time while Wanda and Jorge did the exercise and encouraged viewers to follow along. Robby got permission to use the video and showed it to Desi and Ichiro in the conference room at Sao Do.

“So? What do you think?”

“If Wanda and Jorge demoed harakiri, people would line up to kill themselves,” Ichiro said.

“Can I watch it over and over again continuously for the next month?” Desi asked, “maybe in slow motion.”

“But does the brainwave actually work?” Ichiro asked.

“There have been some early positive results. I figure we can test it here with the beta Game,” Robby suggested. “Otherwise we are going to need to slow down the Queries so that people can actually absorb what they learn.”

“Scratchy won’t like that at all,” Desi said and then, “What about inviting Jorge to Hoi An? Just in case we need another video.”

“Only if Wanda comes too,” Ichiro said.

“Bitch!” Desi said.

“Tramp!” Ichiro said.

“Don’t mind us, dearie,” Desi said to Robby.

Desi put his arm around Robby’s shoulder and led him out into the central compound. “Dr. Robinson, I believe you are making a significant contribution to the effort. How about a raise? Say, an extra million dong a month.”

“How generous, Dr. Venkataraman. Why, that would buy me dinner at your Cuban restaurant.”

“Including mojitos,” Desi said. “Now, tell me more about Jorge.”

Scratchy had a fondness for Burning Guy, which he felt was a logical extension of Rennfayre at Reed. Itchy was in full agreement there, and so they had some of the Sao Do crew build a virtual Burning Guy on Junana.com as a fully adult gathering space. This gave them a good opportunity to test their user authentication routines—fencing the Playa from anyone under eighteen.

While they could hardly recreate the alkaline bite of the dust swirling off the desert, they built in pretty much everything else, including the sun, which rose and fell each day. The avatars were all “clothing optional,” anatomically correct, but non-functional.

“This ain’t no love hotel,” Scratchy declared, “They can wait till White Rock.”

To avoid user fatigue, the Virtual Playa was only open for one month in the spring. Just long enough to support the various BG communities in their preparations for the real Burn and to give newbies a taste of the action. With users from every corner of the world, the Playa was a rich ethnic gumbo. The built-in DocDo technology allowed everyone to freely communicate.

A virtual village supply depot offered a variety of free tents, fabrics, clothing, body paints, lights, sound systems, and flammable objects: balls, sticks, dolls, apparatuses. Actually, anything from the depot could have its flammability property set to any one of various levels, from inert to incendiary. The physics engine supported projectile motion and the Playa was interlaced with flaming objects being twirled, tossed, catapulted, or simply dragged. Avatars and their various body parts were also flammable, and some of the camps looked like self-immolation parties.

Communities were granted camping spaces by lottery. The lattes at the center and booze from the depot had virtual effects on the avatars, which were also required to log out every six hours for a full four hours. Desi was worried about users’ health and wanted people to be active while on the Playa. The avatar would start to yawn five minutes before their time was up and then slowly fade away. The Playa had a clear set of conduct rules designed to keep the interactions symmetrical and voluntary, and violators found themselves logged out permanently, not just from the Playa, but also from Junana.com.

“If they can’t behave themselves on the Playa, I don’t want ’em on Main Street,” Scratchy ruled.

Itchy had his own crew of forty-eight programmers at Sao Do—the ones who had distinguished themselves as graphic artists. He could diagram a device and tell them the behaviors he required, and within a day or so they’d have it ready. The hardest part was to simulate a directional music environment, so that the sound systems from the various camps didn’t result in an unholy sonic clusterfuck. After several experiments, he gave each sound device the ability to broadcast in a 60-degree angle over a space of seven meters.

Itchy’s crew programmed bicycles for users to navigate the life-sized Playa more quickly. They then surprised Scratchy by creating a special vehicle: a spacious flying carpet with a spectacular Tabriz pattern. Two Cordobaloungers, a wet bar, and a sound system were added for comfort. Joysticks on the chair arms steered the carpet, which hovered a foot above the desert floor.

Traveling on the carpet was like taking your living room on a ride through Sin City. All around, mostly naked avatars were dancing to techno, painting their bodies or those of their friends, or setting off flaming projectiles. The carpet had a repeller function that gently swept avatars to the side as it moved. Functional cattle prods discouraged the uninvited from climbing aboard.

The boys would invite half a dozen folks at random to join them for a cruise and party around the Playa for hours. Since they had the only vehicle in the Playa, Winston insisted that they use their aliases. The five of them were still the only individuals on Junana.com who didn’t pass through the identity checker. Jack was a regular visitor. He greatly enjoyed the spectacle and the crowd’s energy, although he draped his avatar in a blue toga. Desi told him he looked like an extra from Animal House.

Every third night after the stiff dick parade (Desi’s favorite event) the Guy was ceremoniously set on fire, surrounded by a thousand naked lesbian cowgirl flame spinners in leather chaps (Winston’s idea and Scratchy’s favorite part). The spinning flames, the gleaming sweat, and the sinuous dance were all testaments to the growing acumen of the Sao Do programming crews.

The second year they did this, they hit the logical limit of thirty thousand participants within hours and opened ten parallel Playas with a jump system in a Technicolor mud bath. You’d hop in and lay down and when you stood up, you’d be in a different Playa. Each was color-coded; all were generally non-violent and entirely non-commercial.

A small fleet of vehicles—some pirate ships, a flaming dragon, a huge inflatable Marilyn Monroe, and an armada of various floating furniture and appliances—were made available through a lottery system.

Itchy’s crew designed an 20-meter-diameter combat dome for the dark-side party boys as an experiment with real-time autonomous learning in a dynamic 3D environment. Suspend two avatars by bungee cords in a huge geodesic dome and give them each a chainsaw. The one that learns the fastest how to move is the one who walks away. The players had general control over attacks and retreats, but the real fighting was done by the avatars, who were given a strong impulse to survive, the instinctual learning to duck, and the know-how to deliver a killing blow. It was the one place on the Playa where violence was allowed.

The learning algorithms were honed by the actual battles and then passed on to subsequent combatants. By the third week, the death matches looked like they’d been choreographed by Yuen Wo-Ping. Each one was different, yet the only hard coding was done in the original learning algorithms.

The guys were now too busy to spend any significant time on the virtual Playa.

“How many years has it been since we last went to Burning Guy? If I don’t get naked and covered with glitter soon...” Desi proclaimed sadly.

The rapid spin up of Junana.com proved invaluable as a test bed for the technologies they would require. When Junana.com hit five hundred million users, Scratchy was concerned that the underlying database might begin to fail. He had ported PostgreSQL onto the templates and added the logical extensions that these allowed, including georeferencing and threaded video streaming. His admin programs showed no slowing of the system whatsoever, apart from the server loads and the Internet, which wasn’t built for anything as successful as Junana.

At nearly a billion users, they had the largest personal information database on the planet. And personal was not close to describing the information the users put on their Junana.com sites. Confessional, intimate, downright embarrassing: Scratchy was amazed at the detail at which the users voluntarily exposed every aspect of their lives. He was glad that the 512bit key kept this information safe.

Amanda Baxter always assigned Moby Dick over the summer, figuring that her students wouldn’t read it anyhow. They might as well join the legions who would never, ever, actually read Moby Dick, but who would probably say they had. Not reading Moby Dick to start the year was simply the first of the many disappointments her students would assemble for Amanda.

But then, this last spring, after 13 years of year-by-year declining results in her classes, she noticed a visible, even remarkable, improvement. The students were lively, engaged, their papers cogent and even passionate, and they read the books. They read Shakespeare. Shakespeare! The other tenth-grade teachers noticed a similar, unexplainable, rise in student work. They could not believe these were the same students that were sleepwalking through their classes just a year ago.

Well, if the entire student body had been taken over by aliens, at least they were intelligent aliens and mostly agreeable. That was another strange and altogether refreshing feeling: walking into a classroom that wasn’t charged with hostility. In a hopeful moment last spring, she assigned The Great Gatsby, one of her personal favorites, as the summer reading requirement for next year’s class.

The passage from 9th grade English to her American literature class marked a significant rise in expectations and goals. Amanda always spent the first quarter sorting out those who would accept their new responsibilities from those who were just, well, floaters. She gave each of the emerging floaters two chances to show she was wrong about them before she cut them loose into C- land, so she could concentrate on those who came to learn. With thirty-five students in the room, something had to give.

Years before, when the politicians soothed their restive constituents by creating national testing schemes, mindless of the unintended consequences, a lot of teachers burned out preparing their students to take the exams. Their classes ceased being occasions for learning and instead became cram schools on test-taking techniques. The joy of discovery, that little light that switched on behind the eyes of a student every so often; those occasions teachers actually lived for, shouldering sixty-hour weeks on the pay of a waitress or a taxi driver: that joy was gone.

The previous winter, Amanda had tried to quit. Jason Woods, the Principal of Santa Barbara High, had become quite adept at deflecting the dissatisfaction of his faculty. He calmly talked her into trying one more year. Then, in the spring, her students blossomed like California poppies. Not only did they perform significantly better in their standard tests, they showed up in the classroom ready to learn. Not all of them, of course, but at least several of them. Amanda had the best quarter she could remember, and so she gave her next class Gatsby for the summer.

Itchy and Desi struggled with the final programming for the Game Guides’ behaviors. Their prototype was an avatar they named JS. JS combined the physical features and personas of two separate individuals. J was an uber-Geek, a walking, talking FAQ. S was a loquacious narcissist, a clever raconteur, self-revealing in an unselfconscious and immodest fashion. The idea was to randomly switch between them to test the routines that controlled their individual interaction styles. Itchy came up with a conceit, a two-way face. Turned one way, and J’s face showed mutton-chops and a full beard below and a bald pate on top. Turned the other way, and the beard became S’s long wavy hair. In the 19th Century in Japan prints of two-way faces called joge-e were a rage. Itchy had a collection of them.

S liked to ramble on like a toastmaster on Red Bull. “Never marry anyone whose name has an umlaut or an accented vowel,” he’d say, “The rest of your life you end up spelling her name out to strangers,” or “I was walking through Washington Square and I saw this woman on the bench, and she was calling to the squirrels. Calling them by name. Then I recognized her. She had been my first literary agent. Now she knew all the squirrels in Washington Square.”

Conversely, J was laconic, spare with a phrase, liable to nod or shrug in response. Ask him anything technical, and he could frame either an answer or a better question. J’s eyes were darker than S’s and his cheeks broader. Turned around, those cheeks became S’s brows, which tended to knit as he spoke. It was Desi’s job to work on the mouth, on the shapes of vocalization. Desi also developed algorithms that translated the content of the speech into a dominant emotional tone. Itchy then used this tone to set the face muscles and the body stance of the avatar. The hardest part was to give each avatar its own style of presentation. They showed the results to Winston, who was amazed at how individuated J was from S. And yet, as he noted, they are both far too direct.

“Most of the time, people hide what they feel,” he offered.

Itchy put in a randomizer that mixed up the bodily response from the vocal content. This “enigmatizer” as Desi termed it, made the avatars appear much more human. Interacting with them one would need to guess about the frame of the conversation. Was it sarcasm? Apathy? Hostility?” The unpredictable lack of correspondence between speech and behavior made them complex in an attractive way. Itchy plugged in the behavioral learning codes and switched them to max to bring JS up to speed in real time.

After a month they showed off JS to Scratchy, who paid them a compliment by writing back, “So, you’ve created another asshole genius avatar. If I hear one more story about this guy’s former girlfriend, I’m going to pull him apart pixel by pixel. Go build someone with tits who knows how to listen.”

Their avatar crew in Sao Do had been tasked to model up a hundred Guides for the start of the Game. Mostly these were attractive humanoids of various ages, from otaku princesses to ancient sages. Some were based on literary or film characters, movie stars or pop singers. Once the Game was live, the crew was given an updated list of ideal friends from the Junana profiles and added new celebrities daily.

When the Game went beta, Desi opened up the door to find his Guide striding across a Moroccan tile floor of a luxury hotel in some fantasy desert oasis. Ricky, barefoot in a creme colored Italian suit with a salmon shirt and tie, moved like a model on a Paris runway. He held out his hand. “Hello, Desi,” he said. “I’m Ricky, and we are going to be such good friends.”
