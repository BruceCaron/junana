# Twenty Six
By the middle of the “Year of the Five Skillings,” hundreds of millions were simply having the time of their lives, and much of it outside the Game. “Go play your instrument, or go paint something,” Guides would order and close down the Game for hours. GameTowns grew cacophonous. Music shops and art stores sold and sold until their shelves were bare.

Back in Sao Do, the compound was ringing with music, theater, and dance. Improvisational Hát chèo theater groups formed and performed almost nightly. Desi joined one of these and took to drumming. Itchy explored photography and Delta blues guitar. Jennifer became fascinated by the ancient Hindu kingdoms, the ruins of which were just inland. Winston and Claire explored each other. All of them advised Scratchy and Betsy to join the Game.

“You’re the most impossible, improbable luddites in the world,” Desi scolded when he caught up to them at the computer center. “Here you are, king and queen of the nerds and you won’t even try the Game!”

Betsy held up one of Anjali’s books. “It’s called cellulose, you make paper out of it, print on it and bind it. Over time it generates the same effect as the Game.”

“We’ve been trolling the Game for unexpected consequences,” Scratchy said. “We were wondering if you unfolded some aphrodisiac template. I’m tracking the Junana back-chatter, and it seems that a lot of Gamers, I’m talking millions here, are getting really frisky.

“They’re teenagers,” Desi reminded them.

“Maybe Red Star should be passing out protection with those body balls.” Back in his room, Scratchy had been doing Master Lu’s program every night. He’d lost about twenty pounds. Not that anybody noticed.

“Have you seen Claire and Winston lately?” Desi grinned.

“They are probably learning the oboe, writing sonnets, or painting landscapes on the river. Whole fucking planet’s one big amateur hour,” said Scratchy.

“Everyone has to start somewhere,” Desi answered.

“I haven’t seen them around, actually,” Betsy said.

“My point entirely! And I’d guess they’re not on the Game.”

“Median player Game time is down over thirty percent,” Betsy said.

“That doesn’t sound good,” Desi said.

“But it is. It means the players are finding better reasons to turn off their screens,” Betsy said. “The Skillings are starting to kick in.”

“That’s exactly what Jenn told me,” Desi said, “‘We’ll know the Game succeeds when the last player shuts off her computer.’”

“And who told the Guides they could act as match-makers?” Scratchy asked.

“Really! That’s interesting.”

“We all pledged to not use the Game to advance our own interests. Now it seems the Game has acquired its own interests, and we don’t have a clue what those are,” said Scratchy.

“Itchy and I have been meaning to talk to you about the Guides. For months we’ve known that they can talk with each other.”

“They what?” said Betsy.

“I’ve been working on it...” Desi said sheepishly. “This capacity is woven into their learned behavior matrix. And we haven’t been able to decipher their message stream.”

“You’ve got several hundred million game pieces communicating internally, and you don’t know what they are saying?” Her eyes shot up. “Do you know how ‘not good’ that can become?”

“We can turn them off completely before they rise up in revolt. We do this for a living, you know.”

“Small fucking comfort that is.”

“She’s right, you know,” said Scratchy. But then Betsy was the least wrong person he’d ever encountered. This impressed him almost as much as it fascinated him. “So the Guides are talking with each other? Why didn’t you bring this up right away?”

“We wanted to crack their code first, but they’re not using any language we know.” Desi remembered the months they spent contemplating creating a new language. Looked like they had done that too, only none of Nerds could speak it.

“Great!” Betsy folded her arms and glared at Desi.

“I have to go,” Desi announced. “Claire’s daughter Megan is arriving at Danang today. She brought her new boyfriend. I hear he’s very cute.” He beat a quick retreat.

Betsy turned to Scratchy. “Did I just hear the wheels coming off this buggy?”

“Hey! We’ve simply opened some doors here and we don’t know what’s on the other side. It’s called innovation....”

“That’s one word for it.”

“...On the up side, we just let a hundred thousand Sixers into Castalia. The grounds are swarming. We gave the Fivers back their Guides in Junana as some kind of ghost buddies. We kicked anomie’s ass.”

“It’s true, suicides are well below pre-Game levels world-wide.”

“What are they supposed to talk about in Junana, these nubile pubescent players and their ghost Guides: the weather? the stock market?”

“That cute girl or boy in their homeroom.”

“Exactly so; a few million players began to ask their new Guide friends if they can get that cute girl’s Guide to put in a good word...”

“...But that cute girl’s Guide knows she’s a vindictive bitch who needs someone with really good boundaries to get her straight. So they find someone else for the player.”

“...someone that only a Guide can locate, who fits the player’s Game profile exactly.”

“With that kind of input to their learning routine the Guides could get pretty good at this.”

“The Guides know more about their players than any friend could possibly know; more than any online dating service.”

“In that case, dating might be the most practical outcome of the entire Game,” Scratchy offered. “I hear wedding bells all over the planet.”

“Everyone falls in love when they’re in high school; only it’s not meant to last. Puppy love is supposed to hurt like hell and then go away. You get over it, and you go get bruised and battered by serial dating for a decade before you figure out that you’re really just looking for someone to talk to. Meeting Mr. Right at the wrong time isn’t any better than meeting Mr. Wrong anytime.”

“I’m not so sure 17 is the same after the Game. What does 17 feel like when you know that much?” Scratchy said. “Anyhow, kids finding each other is arguably better than kids killing themselves.”

“And kids getting master’s degrees at 17 is arguably better than kids sleeping through high school history class. But we don’t know what ‘better’ really means here. ‘Different’ is not automatically better.”

“We may not have to worry about any of this for very long.”

“Meaning...?”

“My security squad is just barely keeping up with the hackers. They could bring us down any day now. We get thousands of probes and hundreds of high-level attacks a day.”

“I’ve got a fool-proof back-up plan for you,” she offered.

“What’s that?”

She held up Anjali’s book. “It’s called cellulose.”

Nick complied with the captain’s instructions and turned off his MP3 player. He nudged Megan awake and leaned over her to look out the window as the Airbus banked to line up for landing in Danang. She rubbed her eyes and did the “Don’t kiss me, I just woke up” thing with her hand over her mouth. He kissed her lightly on the temple as he sat back, and she took hold of his arm and pressed it against her.

“It’s really hard to believe we’re going to meet the Grand Meister,” he said. It felt exactly like the first time he went to Disneyland as a little kid, standing in front of the turnstile, gripping his mom’s hand. There hadn’t been many moments this good between then and now. Except for the day he met Megan. That was the shit to end all shit. He would never forget that day.

Their Guides, Cindy and Bobby, had cooked this whole thing up. About three months after the new skill templates showed up and everyone went back to Level Two, they arranged for Nick to get transferred down to Westwood as a waiter in the Vietnamese vegetarian restaurant. Cindy showed Nick Megan’s photo and ordered Nick to check her profile.

“She is abso-fucking-lutely perfect for you, cowboy. So I’m going to tell you how to treat her right, you know, when the time comes.”

For a Game piece who once told him she was ‘no woman,’ Cindy had this really encyclopedic and sometimes embarrassingly graphic information about how a woman should be touched. Cindy required him do the set of Queries he’d heard rumors about, which covered topics from verbal intimacy to erotic foot massage. By the time he arrived in LA the one thing he knew for certain was that pulling his weight in a relationship was going to take as much focus and energy as another level in the Game.

“Don’t worry about it,” Cindy said. “Megan’s done the same Queries. You two are going stick together like super magnets.”

Megan wore dark jeans and a white tee, cut fairly low, which fit her like paint. He took her order, feeling distinctly like a fool in his fugly waiter’s jacket. She looked up at him and gave out the smallest smile. He blushed like she’d just yanked down his shorts.

“Bring me the best thing in the restaurant, cowboy,” she said. Bobby told her Nick’s Guide called him “cowboy.”

“That would be me,” he returned her smile. “You might also want something from the menu.” He hoped he hadn’t overdone it.

“I’ll start with a bowl of Grand Meister Pho. I’ll get to you later.” She handed back the menu and their hands touched. He was suddenly glad to be wearing a jacket.

He kept checking in on her, filling her water, comping her snacks. She nibbled for maybe five hours until his shift was over. He came out in his favorite Volcom tee and jeans and sat down across from her.

“My roommate’s gone tonight,” she announced, “want to come up and talk?”

They didn’t have sex that night, but they did everything else. It felt so good just being together that they could have water-boarded each other and still had a great time. She moved into his room the next day. It was like they were brother and sister, best childhood friends, frantic lovers, and an old married couple all at once. It was exciting, amazing, and oddly comfortable by turns.

Three months later and here he was, off to spend weeks in Vietnam with her, her mom, the Grand Meister, and Scratchy O’hara too. He glanced out the window again. Vietnam looked a lot like Goleta, only smoggier.

“Harder still to think that my mom has been hanging with the Grand Meister for seven whole months.” Megan tried to smooth down the sleep kinks in her hair with her hands. Her brush was up in her bag.

“You look terrific,” Nick said. “Disheveled becomes you.”

She slumped back in her seat. “Wait till she sees the tatt.” She rolled her eyes. A month after moving into GameTown, Megan and some friends went to this tattoo place down in Santa Monica. Megan got them to do Marmalade’s head on her ankle. It was completely phat. Her mom would hate it.

“Wait till she sees me,” Nick said.

“You, she will love,” Megan predicted. “Or I will never speak to her again.”

She remembered him coming up to her at the restaurant in his waiter costume, all shy and excited. Bobby had shown her his photo, and she’d almost memorized his bioform, so she thought she was prepared. He said something really clever, she remembered. Then he brushed her hand when he took her menu and she thought she was going to cream right there in her seat, like in that old movie with Meg Ryan. Bobby never told her about the electricity. She hung out and tried to act uninterested while she followed him with her eyes all afternoon. He kept bringing her spring rolls and filling her water glass. She had to go pee half a dozen times.

Megan was fully prepared to take him upstairs and do the dirty, but he was just so sweet and she didn’t want it to end; this delicious anticipation. They touched and talked and stroked and talked and kissed and talked and the excitement lingered until they both fell asleep near sunrise entwined on her single bed, still fully clothed.

When she woke up, they were spooned and his hand was was cradling her tummy. She kissed him awake and asked him right away if she might move to his room. He could hardly say no. That’s when they did it. She had a full-on joygasm before he even really got started and two more before he collapsed. Seemed like he just lit her fuse and off she went. It hurt a bit too. Bobby had warned her it might. The last few weeks all Bobby would talk about on Junana was this special set of Queries, which everyone at Gametown was calling “Sex Ed 101.” In between them he had this whole presentation about what to expect and how to stay safe.

Megan and Nick squeezed together in her little shower and nearly did it again just from the soapy friction, but Nick was almost dead from hunger. They’d skipped dinner last night and he had worked through lunch. So they got dressed and headed down to the restaurant floor. After lattes and breakfast burritos at the GameTown Red Star, where she was now the head barista, he helped her move.

When she unpacked she discovered Nick had most of the same books she did; like entire collections of Doctorow and Burdett. Bobby and Cindy, both of them way too self-congratulatory about Megan and Nick moving in together, processed the roommate switch request with Nick’s floor monitor’s Guide. This made everything legit as far as GameTown was concerned. Nick was sure his mom didn’t care. Megan was sure her mom would freak. They put the two beds together, splurged on new sheets at Restoration Hardware, and bought an ugly cheap sofa at Urban Outfitters.

The Airbus landed on what might be the world’s largest runway, built by the Americans during their Vietnam adventure. Megan and Nick had Queried up the war and more recent information about Vietnam. Customs was expedited by the help of an official who took their passports and led them into an air-conditioned office.

“Sit here, friends of the Grand Meister.” He pulled some colas from a small refrigerator. “I will not be long.”

Several minutes later they were pushing their luggage on the cart through the Green Line and out to where Megan saw her mother making that happy wave thing by holding up her hand and wiggling her fingers. A tall, amazingly handsome East Indian man stood next to her. Is that him? Megan looked over at Nick, who was walking much too slow.

“Speed it up, cowboy,” she whispered. “Let’s get this over with.”

There were hugs all around, even after Megan introduced Nick by saying, “Mom, this is Nicholas. Nick and I are a couple in every imaginable sense of the word.” This struck the Grand Meister as funny, and his laughter got them all through the moment.

“You simply must call me ‘Desi,’” the Grand Meister insisted. “Lord knows I’m not the Pope!”

On the ride back, Nick sat in the middle between Megan and her mom. Desi sat up front. The road was windy and the driver fast. The mood was high. Desi talked about how the five skillings were transforming the Game space, and how lucky they were that Claire and her friends had joined the team.

Megan used the left-hand curves to push against Nick, sending him sideways into her mom. He’d apologize and give Meg a scolding look, which she did not appreciate. So she tucked her hand between his legs and squeezed this spot on his thigh she know had a predictable effect. Nick squirmed in his seat and pushed her hand away. Claire covered a smile by looking out her window.

Desi turned to look at them and said to Claire, “If these two aren’t the happiest couple on the planet, although you and Winston are a close second.”

“Winston?” Megan leaned across Nick to hear her mom’s response. “Who is this “Winston” of which I’ve been hearing?”

“Well...” Claire hesitated.

Desi cut in. “Your mom and Winston go way back. When she was not much older than you, they were a couple in every imaginable way, but only for about two days. You know, they took mushrooms and ran naked through a public golf course.”

“Way too much information!” Megan said, throwing up her hands.

“I agree,” Claire said.

“Don’t stop,” Nick grinned. “We should always be open to learn from our elders.”

“That’s a word you could go all day without ever saying again,” Claire noted.

“All I’m saying is that we are losing track of what it was like, you know, before.”

“Before what?”

“The Game, of course.”

Desi and Claire shared a glance.

“Oh, my God! He’s right!” Desi said. “Now I feel positively... Neanderthal.”

Essie entered the classroom and hung her red cloak on the hook reserved for it alone. A dozen students, eleven girls and one boy, sat at their desks with hands folded in front of their Computos. Three of them wore the hats, and one girl, Miina, had her shoulder bag.

“Wa lala po, class,” Essie greeted them.

“Wa lala po, Meister Essie,” they replied in unison.

Already it was hot, and their uniforms were heavy. But they would never imagine coming to school without them, any more than they could imagine leaving class without first sweeping out the room.

“This morning you will be Querying with your Guides,” she said. “I see no reason not to do so over at the river, where the breeze is steady.”

The students relaxed and smiled at each other.

“This afternoon, after our lunch, we will be working on our English conversation and discussing the political argument between John Locke and Thomas Hobbes. The KayAye has had you Query their work over the weekend, so I expect a lively debate.

“Yes, Meister Essie,” they replied in unison.

At the very posh beachfront hotel, Nick was given a key to his room. An extra bed had been ordered for Claire’s suite.

“Now you’re just being stupid,” Megan snapped at Claire. “Anyhow, aren’t you sleeping with Winston?”

“I’m not your warden,” Claire admonished. “You can sleep wherever you wish. The bed is simply there if you need it.”

Megan then gave her mom the real hug she’d been saving all this time. “I think you’ve really grown these last months,” she said.

“That’s my line!” Claire drank in her daughter’s display of affection.

“Yeah, I just thought I’d try it out.”

“It fits all of us pretty well.” Winston had also changed in these months, she mused. “We’ve all learned a lot.”

Megan held her mom’s hand and they moved to the balcony overlooking the pool.

“I know I’m just at the start of this long winding path, and you’re up there on a plateau looking down at all the twists and ravines I’ve got to navigate,” Megan said. “I’m just really happy I’ll have Nicky with me when the rope bridge washes out. And this metaphor is now crashing pitifully around my ankles.”

“Your Guides sent you through Sex Ed 101?” Claire asked.

Megan blushed. “The whole enchilada. You know about that?”

“Both of us got the same lessons. Probably at the same time.”

That’s freaky,” Megan said mostly to herself. She looked down at her feet. “Speaking of ankles...”

Megan used the tip of one shoe to roll down the sock on the other foot. Marmalade’s head poked out.

“Nice tatt!” Claire said.

“What!” Megan started. “That’s it?”

“But not as nice as mine.” Claire rolled up her shirtsleeve to reveal a small red design. The familiar outline of a cloak, identical to Jenn’s.

“You made it!” Megan jumped and clapped her hands. “Look!” she called Nick over.

“Way to go, Claire!” he smiled.

Claire stepped up and hugged him. “Just don’t ever, let me repeat, ever, call me ‘mother,’” she whispered into his ear.

“This is not a coffeehouse! Kindly remove your hats,” Amanda Baxter reminded her students. She was wearing her yellow blouse for effect. Hats disappeared into blue shoulder bags. Amanda glanced at the faces of her class, their desks gathered in a semicircle. Their eyes carried intelligence, a hint of defiance, a spark of curiosity, and not a whisper of hostility.

She figured there would not be a single floater in the group. They were dressed in a melange of recent retro fashions, thrift store bargains and garage-sale finds. A lot of home sewing in evidence; kids were now mashing up their own fashions. She noticed that every one of them was covered up, even Britany Sloane, who wore an oversized grey sleeveless sweatshirt upon which someone had neatly hand lettered, “Derrida can kiss my derrière.”

“Welcome back. This is a class for Fourveys and above. We are starting with a discussion, so you can close your laptops,” she wrote the name on the blackboard out of habit and turned to them. “Your KayAye had you query up his work on hermeneutic anthropology. Oh yes, how many of you are in the Pinter play this Friday?”

Several hands went up. “You’ll be excused early. Your Guides will let you know what you missed. I’m assuming you read Time and Narrative over the Christmas break.”

“Or last night!” Sam Cross quipped. The class laughed. Sam reminded her greatly of Nick Landreu. Her Guide told her Nick has founded a theater group in Westwood based on the street theater forms he discovered while in Vietnam.

“Well, Sam. If you read all three volumes last night, I would suggest we move back, because your head might explode at any time.”

“You’re telling me!” he said.

“Let’s begin our conversation on Paul Ricoeur’s concept of ‘narrativity,’” she continued. “Britany, will you start us out?”

Simon awoke from a troubled sleep. He had dreamed he was encased in spider webs, wound about him like a shroud. The webs turned into templates. Try as he might he could not unfold them. They tightened around his face, smothering him.

He sat up in bed, his room diffused by the dawn. He grabbed a pint of milk from the mini-fridge and went to his computer. As it booted he did the Brainwave movements without effort or thought. His thoughts were already on the templates. The whole structure of the Game unwound before him as he Queried up a new approach. He had been neglecting the province of the Five Skillings, still stung by the rebuke he felt from the Grand Meister. He would need to reexamine these if he was to move ahead.

The sunset threw sharp shadows on his monitor as he unwound the Social template a final time. He closed his eyes as he typed. He no longer needed the visual clues to wend his way back to the root template. The Social did not socket back to Intention-full or Noel; it was grounded outside of these, but where? Not intention, not choice, but action.

Action was the missing root. The third leg out there, just beyond his grasp. He pointed his Query in that direction and was on the verge of attaining a purchase on the problem of agency when the Game seemed to freeze for a time, like the video stuck on a frame. This had happened several times in the past week. He waited, his stomach grumbled at him. He closed his eyes and continued his Query mentally. Action requires intention and choice and something more, a field. Yes, an open-ended field. A new chain of templates unfolded in front of him. The field of action is two sided. One side is grounded in the past, the other side is necessarily underdetermined. Agency transforms intention through choice into action. Simon opened his eyes. Then the Game screen displayed:

“Answer Hazy, Try Again.”

Suddenly his avatar was holding a tall wooden staff. An instant later the Game simply quit. Not like it might normally, back when Eldrick told him go eat. It just threw him out and went black.

“Wait a minute? What just happened?”

He tried to log back in but the connection timed out. Then he logged into Junana. He was redirected to something called Unana.com.

“What the...!” He spun his avatar around to get a good a look at his home plaza. Behind him, towering like some monumental Aztec pyramid was a church the size of a football stadium. An enormous rose window glowed psychedelic from the interior lighting. Towering spires vanished into the dark sky. Above the massive medieval doors he could make out words carved in stone. Ultra-Conservative Congregationalist Convention.

“Oh, no!” he cried.

Simon covered his face with his hands. Someone was a pounding on his dorm room door. They did not sound happy.
