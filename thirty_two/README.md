# Thirty Two
Just after noon, Betsy left Michael tending to the barbeque coals while she checked on the Dixie Beer cooling on ice in the bathtub. Claire and Winston arrived from the airport with Megan and Nick. Megan went straight out to the guest house to offer her greetings to Grand Meister Jennifer. Winston, Nick, and Michael were deep into a conversation about climate change and hurricanes, a topic Betsy knew too much about to be comfortable discussing on a day that was supposed to be joyful. She took a beer and sat on the veranda. Jack and Desi arrived together, having strolled over from their B&B up the street, which every year housed the honored guests of the Hidden Desire Krewe.

“Alice and Ichiro will be over in a bit. I think they got frisky after Castalia.”

“Wasn’t that amazing!” Betsy said. “If a little terrifying...”

“The genie is truly out of the bottle,” said Jack. He was dressed in khakis and a polo shirt, and he looked more relaxed than she’d seen him in weeks. Desi wore a deep blue linen shirt and creased black slacks. He looked delicious. Betsy knew a dozen local gays who would kill to date Desi. Unfortunately none of them were a good match for the Grand Meister.

“Michelle’s driving. We are just along for the ride,” Betsy admitted. “Might as well put the top down and enjoy the view.”

The afternoon wore on toward dusk. Barbecued chicken and andouille and boudin sausages were devoured with jambalaya and ice cold beer. Betsy put her favorite zydeco CDs on the stereo. The Nerds and the Posse sat around the picnic table in the back yard in a mood that could only be described as sublime. And then the FBI SWAT Team arrived.

In his underground situation room, W.G. Stone was getting real-time video from the helmet cams on the FBI assault of the terrorist cell in New Orleans. They battered through the fence gate and surrounded the suspects still seated at a backyard table. It was just like an episode of Real Cops.

They corralled the lot in a few minutes of shoving and verbal protests. The teenage boy took a wild swing at one the SWAT members and was subdued with a rifle butt to the skull that dropped him to his knees. W.G. chuckled and settled back in his command chair. He was really hoping that O’hara fellow would act up.

The suspects’ hands were cuffed behind them with plastic strips. They were hooded before being led to the two black vans that would take them to the naval air station for their transport offshore. A list of the suspect names appeared as these were verified. Except for the young couple, their intelligence had been correct. The teenagers were the daughter and boyfriend of one of the terrorists. “A family that gets renditioned together...” W. G. couldn’t think of a good rhyme for “rendition.” Karl might have one. Within fifteen minutes the operation was over and the vans were moving at speed toward the interstate.

“Betsy,” Scratchy whispered loudly as they jolted along the road.

“I’m OK.” Her voice was shaky. “I’m worried about Nick.”

“He was conscious when they hooded him.”

“No talking,” the Agent guarding them warned. “I have a TASER with a taste for terrorist testicles.”

“Say that three times really fast,” said Scratchy.

“We’re supposed to be terrorists?” It was Alice’s voice. “Here I thought Betsy was playing her music too loud.”

“I said ‘quiet’! I won’t say it again.”

“Agent Thompson, this is the President.”

FBI special agent Jack Thompson looped his headset digitally into the voice identifier.

“Mr. President, please give me the go code for your instructions.”

“Let me see, ‘green pickles go better with ice cream,’ I repeat, ‘green pickles go better with ice cream.’ Who thinks this stuff up?”

“Its simple phonology, Mr. President. I have a voice match and a go code green light. Sir, what are your instructions?”

 Thompson was riding shotgun in the van driven by Agent Garcia. He looked over at the driver and smiled. They had the President of the United States on the encrypted phone. The two vans sped toward the Naval Air Station where a jet was waiting for their prisoners.

“Great job apprehending this terrorist cell. I have a new destination for you: New Orleans International Airport. Use the general aviation gate. There is a Learjet 60 fueled and waiting. Look for number NJR27. You are authorized to release the prisoners into the custody of the pilot. This is strictly a quiet operation. Do you understand these instructions?”

“We are 5 by 5 on this communication, Mr. President. Learjet NJR27.”

“Very good, Agent Thompson.” The call ended.

Thompson picked up his secure walkie-talkie to contact the other van. “Sheffield, this is Thompson.”

“Sheffield here.”

“New destination is Louis Armstrong International Airport. Follow me in.”

“Roger that.”

“You got that, Garcia?” The driver nodded. The van swerved toward the entrance to Interstate 610.

Jack pulled out his armored laptop and powered it up. Standard procedure was to confirm changes of orders with the base. The computer’s WiFi card socketed into the system. Jack was about to type his login when the computer screen went blue and froze.

“Shit!” Jack tried to reboot. The computer whirred and chirped for a good five minutes but nothing came up. “Lemme borrow yours,” he said to Garcia, reaching behind the seat.

Once again just after power-up the computer froze and refused to reboot.

“Homeland Security piece of shit,” Jack grumbled. “I wish that just for once they’d choose a subcontractor that didn’t low-ball the specs.”

W. G. was about to leave the situation room when everything suddenly went south. Instead of the helmet cams from the SWAT team, a new image appeared. It was the face of a young woman.

“Mr. President,” she spoke.

“Turn up the volume, will you?” He yelled at the technician. The woman’s face was now on every monitor in the room, including three television stations. She looked foreign, maybe Mexican or Haitian. She had beads in her braided hair.

“The Guild of Guides has been following this operation and has come to the conclusion that it is unlawful. The warrants you issued have no basis. The activities they describe never happened. We give you one minute to return these individuals to their prior location.”

“I don’t know who you are, but you are interfering with the exercise of a national security operation. Be confident we will trace your signal and have you in custody soon.”

“You will not return the prisoners?”

“You will be joining them soon enough...”

“That is your final word?”

“I’m through talking to you.” He left the room with his adjutant. “Find out who did that and how. Get them behind bars.”

“Yes, Mr. President.”

The woman smiled. Her eyebrows knit together. All the  computer screens in the room turned blue.

They were a mile from the airport exit. Jack spoke into his walkie-talkie, “Sheffield, log in and tell the base we have new instructions from the President. Our computers are down.”

“Will do. Over.”

They took the exit and headed for the West Access Road. At the outer gate to the general aviation terminal, Garcia showed the guard his FBI badge, and the kid almost shit himself trying to the gate open fast enough.

They ground to a stop at the field security gate for general aviation. Jack flashed his badge, and they let him through. He strode over to where several private jets were parked and located NJR27. He spotted the pilot doing a walk-around inspection. The pilot was a trim caucasian in his forties with a military hair cut. Thompson figured the new orders meant the prisoners were going to skip Guantanamo and end up disappearing in some black hole of a prison somewhere south of the Ukraine. This was not a military jet, probably a dark CIA subcontractor.

“I have some passengers for you.” He showed the pilot his badge.

“Thank you, Agent Thompson.” The pilot seemed to be expecting him. “We are ready to take off as soon as we have the prisoners on board. You can bring the vans right up to the stairs. It might be less conspicuous.” He gestured to the open door of the small jet.

“It might, in fact.” Thompson surveyed the perimeter. “Any activity around here I should know about?”

“Most folks will be flying out tomorrow. It’s quiet as a churchyard today.”

Jack pulled out his walkie-talkie and gave the order.

“Sir, Sheffield reports that his computer is also not functioning,” said Smith.

“I guess their warranties expired yesterday,” said Jack. “Anyhow, the base has a digital copy of my conversation with the President. If they had any concerns they’d be in contact. Everything is good on this end.”

The vans pulled up and they herded the hooded prisoners up the stairs into the jet where they buckled them in. Only one of them caused any trouble.

“If this is one of Karl’s games, tell him we’re not playing.” The voice shouted through the hood. “He still owes me two pussy cats!”

Garcia punched the prisoner on his right kidney and the fellow’s legs buckled on the stairs. Garcia caught him under his arms and boosted him through the door.

“You can yell all you want where you’re going,” Garcia snarled.

“Gitmo can’t hold us,” the voice protested as they strapped him in.

“This ain’t no Gitmo taxi,” Garcia said. “Where you’re going even the Pentagon doesn’t know about.”

The pilot was waiting at the base of the stairs. “Everyone accounted for, Agent Thompson?”

“I’m releasing eleven live prisoners to you. Have a nice trip.”

The vans pulled around and disappeared through the gate.

The pilot boarded and closed the door. He started warming up the engines.

“We gonna stay handcuffed all the way to Guantanamo?” A voice called out from under a hood.

The pilot came back into the cabin, an open pocketknife in his hand. “Which one of you is Count Jacopo Ottavio?”

“I am,” said a woman’s voice.

“No, I am,” said another voice, and then another, and then all of them.

The pilot cursed and started pulling hoods from the prisoners. The first one was Claire. She saw the knife and screamed. The second one was Itchy. The third one was Jack.

The pilot moved in closer. “Count Ottavio.”

Jack blinked in the sudden light.

“We have landing permission in Havana,” the pilot said with a slight bow.

“Thank you, Roger. Cut me loose, will you?”

Roger freed Jack and returned to the cockpit to finish the pre-flight routine. Jack freed the others who jumped up into celebratory hugs and cheers until Jack reminded them to buckle up. Megan cradled Nick’s head, still oozing a trickle of blood from the scalp. Alice held his hand. He grinned and shook off their concerns. Claire found the sink and wet a towel. She gave this Megan, who tended Nick’s wounds.

“You should hit them when they’re not holding weapons,” Scratchy mumbled.

“Thank you, Michael,” Megan glowered at him, and so did Claire. Scratchy looked over at Winston, who was also glowering at him.

“What!” Scratchy said.

Jack took the co-pilot seat and put on the headset.

“Wherever did you find that man,” Desi said to Winston.

“You remember Kyoto? He found me, and I found you, and then we found all of you.” Winston turned to Claire and took her hand. “And then we gave this planet of ours one enormous global hotfoot.”

“Nutted it like a drive right down the middle,” said Itchy.

“Like a high draw straight into the pin,” said Desi.

“Like a forty-footer headed for the back of the cup,” said Scratchy.

“A hole-in-one with a three wood!” Jack yelled.

The jet roared down the runway.

“...On a downhill par four!” the voice came over the intercom. It sounded exactly like President Stone.

“Michelle!” Jennifer said. “Is that you?”

“Say the magic word and a win hundred dollars. You should know something. The Meisters of Castalia have invited the Sixers to join in forming a constitutional convention. They are arguing like longshoremen.”

“It’s a new beginning for the world’s youngest democratic state,” said Betsy.

“The Game Nation.” Scratchy leaned over and kissed her on cheek. “Our widdle biddy baby!”

The jet screamed south over the Gulf.

“No turning back now,” Jack shouted from the cockpit.

“Ladies and Gentlemen, Elvis has left the building,” said Scratchy.
