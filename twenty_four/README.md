# Twenty Four
Itchy and Desi were in Vietnam, where it was four in the morning. Jack was having dinner in his club in London with his cell phone turned off and surrendered at the desk, as though it were a derringer. The club was particularly strict about this, and Jack approved entirely. Scratchy was on the deck of his hale in Kona.

Back in Santa Fe, the Posse refilled their coffee and chatted vigorously. Winston took a stroll outside. He felt like a kid who had accidentally done something enormously wrong: burned down the courthouse with a firecracker, crashed his father’s car into the side of a bank, flooded the school gymnasium with one flush.

The mounting sequence of near disasters of late also made him wonder how long their luck would hold. First the Room gets hacked, then the Game goes down, and then Scratchy gets kidnapped. What next?

“Someone’s on the line,” Alice called from the door. Winston returned to the room, avoiding eye contact.

Within minutes Itchy, Scratchy, and Desi were all on the phone.

“Scratchy!” Desi said. “You sound wonderful. Does that mean you’re all better?”

“They used drugs on me,” Scratchy said.

“Silly them,” said Itchy.

“I wouldn’t recommend curare for everyone, but it worked for me.”

Winston stalled to give time for Jack to call in. “You remember Claire,” he said to the Nerds. “From RennFayre, senior year.”

There was a long pause.

“Was she the freshman with the champagne?” Itchy asked.

“That’s right,” Winston said.

“You guys streaked the back nine at Eastmoreland,” Desi remembered.

“Must have been the mushrooms,” noted Scratchy. “Made you frisky.”

“And humped like bonobos for hours listening to Blondie up in your room,” said Itchy.

“Must have been the Quaaludes,” added Scratchy.

Claire looked up at the ceiling, feeling the blush on her cheeks.

“We had breakfast together, that Sunday, up on the hill,” Desi said. “You ate something like three omelets each.”

Winston could actually still remember how strangely tasty they were.

“Could have been the acid I put in our OJ,” Scratchy said.

“So that’s what happened to Sunday!” Claire said. “It got all smeared and sparkly.”

“You put acid in our OJ?” Itchy said. “Why Michael, how could you! Wish I’d thought of that.”

“You put acid in our OJ?” Desi said. “I put acid in our OJ! Little windowpanes, one per glass.”

“Now that’s what happened to Sunday,” Scratchy said. “We ate all the drugs we had left over from the whole year.”

The Posse shared a knowing glance. Alice started giggling.

“Jennifer and I have already met,” Desi said.

“Hello, Grand Meister,” she said.

“Didn’t I tell you she was sharp? Dearie, you can call me Desi.”

“And he makes a mean mojito,” Itchy said.

There was an awkward moment of silence.

“I don’t think Jack’s going to make the call,” Scratchy said finally. “Something tells me the scheiss and the ventilator have made contact.”

“I’m going to email you Dr. Berteotti’s slides so you can get up to speed.

For the next hour, Betsy went through the entire presentation again, including the parts she had skipped the first time around. When it was over, the room fell quiet.

“Fuck anomie!” Scratchy broke the silence. “We are not in the happiness business. People have to find their own happiness. At least now they know they’re unhappy, instead of buying another day of happiness on credit.”

“What do you think, Jennifer?” Desi asked.

“The Game is a tool box. Right now it holds seven types of hammer. So it treats the world like everything is a nail. Let’s redo Level Two. I’d like to add a saw and a screwdriver.”

“A piano and a paint brush,” said Claire.

“A pen and a tennis racquet,” added Alice.

“How about a dildo?” said Betsy.

“Now you’re talking!” said Desi.

“Where does it end?” Itchy asked.

“It doesn’t end,” said Jennifer. “It just gets richer and richer.”

“So nobody ever leaves Level Two?” Alice asked.

“Not without a rounded portfolio of skills.”

“What kind of skills are you talking about?” Scratchy asked.

“Mostly ones you don’t seem to have,” Betsy returned.

“You think I’m suicidal, sweetie?”

“You built a game without joy.”

“You got a template for joy?”

“Just a hunger.”

“Then welcome to my world.”

“I wish Jack were here,” said Winston.

“Wish granted.” A new voice joined in on the speaker phone.

“Jack!” Desi said.

“I phoned in midway through the presentation. Who all is in the room?”

Winston did the introductions.

“You forget to tell him about RennFayre,” Desi said.

“Moving right along,” said Winston. “I’m wondering about our next step.”

The room fell silent.

“Step one. Give them hope,” Jennifer said. “Remember, they are only teenagers. They still need to believe that life has more openings than traps.”

“To start off, stop killing the Guides,” Claire suggested.

“Everything dies,” Scratchy mumbled. “That’s a template too, or it should be.”

“Problem is, the Guides can’t follow into Level Five,” Itchy explained. “Having them die, or so we thought, would help the players move on independently.”

“None of us thought the Gamers would actually grieve for their Guides,” Winston said. “That was really unexpected.”

“Why not make them ghosts?” Alice asked.

“In the Game?” Itchy asked. “Ghost or not, they don’t help anyone on Level Five.

“What about in Junana? A ghost buddy that only you can see and hear?” Claire suggested.

“Like Topper!” said Desi. “How delicious!”

“Even though the Guide dies, we keep the program,” Itchy said, “just in case players slip back from Level Five. So we could easily pull the Guide out of the Game into Junana and give it a custom invisibility property.”

“Will that stop people from killing themselves?” Winston asked, looking over at Betsy. They all turned to her.

“It might for a while. Maybe long enough to program version 2.0.”

“My top three teams can put this ghost programming into our next Scrum sprint, have it back to you in two weeks,” Itchy offered. “Meanwhile we can just delay anyone else completing Level Four.”

“Death takes a holiday,” Scratchy said. “I got this feeling I’m going to be busy.”

“Busy, busy, busy!” Desi echoed. “Next step?”

“Full speed ahead with the new design,” Jack said. “Can you all gather in Sao Do?”

“Where?” Claire asked.

“Vietnam,” Winston said. He’d been hoping to go there. “What about you, Jack?”

“I still have work to do that requires my presence elsewhere. I’ll send the yacht through the Canal and catch up to it in a few months off the coast of Vietnam.”

“My daughter...” Claire said, realizing that she didn’t even think twice about her business. Con|Int was history.

“Megan will love Sao Do,” Desi said. “There are several children her age at the same Level.”

“I’m sure she will be thrilled to meet the Grand Meister.”

“Not when she sees him in the morning,” Itchy said.

“Bitch.”

“Cow.”

“Ladies, please,” Scratchy said.

“Consider yourselves on Junana salary, starting today,” Winston said, making eye contact around the room. Claire gave him that look again. He grinned back at her.

“Just so I’m back for Mardi Gras next year,” Betsy said.

“We should all do Mardi Gras next year!” Desi added.

“What’s the timeline for Version 2.0?” Winston asked.

“Four months puts the heat on us to get it done. Anything longer will stretch into a year,” Itchy said. “Once we get new templates unfolded, we can put the whole staff on it.”

“Busy, busy, busy,” Scratchy said.

“Stay on target,” Winston added.

“This must be what General Motors feels like when they recall a million cars to fix that ignition-switch fire thing,” Winston said.

“Only we’re recalling a hundred million players back to Level Two,” Jack added.

“Good thing Jack runs a coffee business,” Desi said. “It’s triple lattes for the duration!”

“I’ll drink to that,” Betsy said.

“Here’s to the new Game 2.0,” Claire raised her coffee cup the others followed.

“Friend or anomie!” Scratchy said. “See you all in Sao Do.”

“Mikey, please, for me, leave all your wardrobe back in Kona,” Desi pleaded. “We’ll fit you out over here.”

“I’ve gone totally hemp,” Scratchy announced. “Down to the boxers.”

“No! Repeat after me: ‘Hemp is for smoking, silk is for undies.’”

“Is that some kind of Grand Meister mantra?”

“It’s for your own good.”

“Just have a mojito ready.” He hung up.

The remaining Nerds said their farewells, Winston sat and stared at the speaker phone.

“First question,” Betsy said. “Dr. Fairchild?” Winston looked up at her.

“Who did the shoes?”

“That was Jack’s idea.”

“It was abso-fucking-lutely brilliant. Who’s Jack?”

“I’m going to let you chew on that one for a while.”

“Why Yanagi University?” Alice asked.

He told them about the public bath in Kyoto, and about Robby, who figured the Gamers deserved academic credit for their work.

“Why did you do it?” Claire asked.

“The Game?”

“No, the Black Dahlia Murder.”

“It started as a prank. The original idea was to goose the world system, but we could never figure out how. We wanted to invent something that would impact the marketplace in a new way. Scratchy suggested we invent new people.”

“New people?” Alice asked.

“Instead of a new tool, a new user. That took us into education, and the Game emerged.”

“From the templates,” Jennifer said. Winston nodded.

“We haven’t made any money on this, quite the reverse. It’s taken about all we’ve got to get this far.”

“Your prank is probably the best single thing that’s happened to the planet in a century or more,” Betsy said.

“You called it a monstrosity.”

“Even monsters can do good. The whole planet was headed for Nerdville anyhow, only you got us there in two years instead of two lifetimes. Now we have the opportunity to go further. You accelerated the process and gave us an engine to keep this going.”

“Why do I feel like I strangled a puppy?”

“It’s because you are low on doughnuts.” Claire brought a plate of doughnuts around to him. They made lingering eye contact. Alice glanced over at Jennifer and grinned. Claire returned to her chair.

“We need lunch. We need sunshine. We need a long walk through an ancient settlement,” Jennifer announced. “There are a million things to talk about and this room is closing in on us.”

“Well, enjoy your afternoon,” Winston said.

“Sorry, amigo.” Alice came around the table to where Winston was sitting. She picked up a doughnut covered with powdered sugar. Winston looked up at her.

“I now brand you a full member of the Posse.” She popped Winston on the forehead with the doughnut. A white circle remained. “Get your hiking shoes on.”

Grinning, Winston looked around the room. The Posse returned his smile. “I guess we’d better all saddle up, pilgrims,” he said in his best Duke voice.

He stood and his hand drifted to the doughnut plate. Alice backed off and ducked just as he shagged a crumb doughnut at her head; it hit the wall and rebounded. Jennifer caught Claire in the chin with a cinnamon hole, and the room erupted with flying pastries.

Megan was adamant. Claire could run off to Vietnam without her. Even the idea of hanging with the Grand Meister would not budge her. Claire argued that she could not leave Megan alone in the apartment, and Megan countered that the new GameTown was opening up near UCLA. Since Claire and the Grand Meister were such good friends, perhaps she would help Megan and her friend secure a room there.

“Don’t even begin to say I’m too young,” she said, pointing to her diploma on the wall of the kitchen.

“Eighteen is still the age of legal responsibility,” Claire said.

“We’ll have to work on that,” Megan sounded serious. Claire realized that was certainly true.

“Sao Do sounds charming; they even have a movie theater.”

Megan made a gun with her finger and shot herself in the forehead.

“But what will you do?”

“I got a job.”

“When?”

“Weeks ago, before the Game went down. I’m a barista at the Red Star Coffee house on Broxton in the Village.”

“A job! Honey, you didn’t tell me. What about your classes at Santa Monica City College?”

Megan just looked at her.

“OK. I get it.”

“The work pays enough to keep me fed, I don’t need many clothes.”

“You’ve got an answer for everything.” Claire couldn’t believe she just said that.

“You’re planning to be gone for months. I can stop by here and make sure the plants are OK, check the mail. I’m more useful here than moping around in Vietnam.”

“In the summer, you’ll come and visit. All right?”

“Sure, I’m not against travel, but I’ve got my own life to figure out.”

“I don’t know.”

“You can always reach me. I’m either chatting on Junana, or I’m in the Game, or I have my phone. There will be a hundred Gamers around me, any one of which would cut off his right arm if the Grand Meister asked him to. So if I get in any kind of trouble, I’ll contact you, and we’ll work it out.”

“You’ll need to buckle down and finish Level Five.” This signaled her capitulation. Megan came over and gave her a hug.

“For an anthropologist you sure worry a lot.” She kissed her mom on the forehead. “Don’t you have a lot of packing to do?”

The Westwood GameTown opened up the week after Claire left for Vietnam. Megan and her friend Juli moved in the first day. They had a third-floor cube with a view down toward Century City. Using her wages and tips and resident discount, Megan could afford the restaurants in the GameTown, with money left over to get down to the beach sometimes. She snuck into some lectures at UCLA but found them mega-tedious. One guy speaks, and three hundred people are supposed to sit there and bask in his intellectual wonderfulness. She came back to her cube and Queried the same content in five minutes.

Desi had predicted that Meisters would be those one-in-a-million players so absorbed in the Game, or else so compulsively obsessed, that they would not stop until they found the key that turned the templates into toys. Only then could they begin to wind and unwind the templates from root to capstone and back. Among the Meisters, perhaps one in a thousand would arrive at the transcendental point where these template strands became woven into an interlocking fabric. These would become Grand Meisters. Desi was the first Grand Meister to emerge. It still took him hours of contemplation on the overall emergent template structure to begin to walk between these as they raveled and unwound about him.

As a way of knowing the world, templates would disappoint anyone looking for clear signposts. Like Zen koan, they pointed obliquely to solution spaces for specific problems. While the problems were specific, the solutions were synthetic, poly-contextual, not quite arbitrary, but always relative. Fleas, they were, on Schrödinger’s cat.

Scratchy’s Noel template still anchored a part of the overall template tapestry and Intention-full grounded others, but floating outliers suggested still other, undiscovered anchor points, and even the possibility of hidden subtending templates.

If being a Grand Meister meant that Desi was all-knowing, then he was a poor one. Rather, he admitted to the Nerds, it just meant he had exhausted what the Game could offer. He had reached a point where his Queries began to soak up CPU time to the max that Scratchy had set up, at which point the Game replied using one of several non-committal answers from the Magic 8-Ball: “Reply hazy, try again,” or “Better not tell you now.”

“Being a Grand Master just means I can’t play anymore,” he groused.

Jennifer arrived at Sao Do from Paris through Hanoi, two days after the Santa Fe meeting. She flew to Hue and took the famous train ride to Danang, the tracks hugging the coast on vertiginous jungle ridges. Desi installed her in a cabana at the beachfront Hoi An hotel where they would all be staying. In fact, it was the same hotel where they held the third Nerdfest several years earlier. Jack had enlarged his equity stake in the hotel chain. A wing of cabanas were reserved for the whole group. Directly behind the hotel, the Thu Bon River led upstream to Hoi An proper and, 20 minutes by fast boat, to Sao Do.

Alice and Claire took new direct flight from LAX to Danang and shared a taxi to the hotel, riding down past China Beach and the new suburban housing developments. This looked way too much like Orange County, Claire observed, after the fifth gated community. Betsy took the same flight several days later. Annika and her new friend would housesit Betsy’s Garden District home. They were insufferable, she knew, both of them in their yellow blouses, but they were reliable.

Her first night in Hoi An, Alice and Claire took Betsy to Ricardos. The setting was pure MGM: balustrades of teak, red tile floors, cream stucco walls, a view out across the broad Thu Bon river, a live salsa band, and waiters who floated around the room in starched white jackets. Giant ferns in Chinese ceramic pots gave each table its own privacy. Desi personally made them mojitos, which they could hardly accept from the Grand Meister.

“Don’t be silly,” he told them. “Besides,” he said to Claire, “I knew you when you were a lascivious undergrad.”

Desi doted on Betsy, whom he christened “Liz.”

“You can call me Lucy,” he told her. “I’ve got a little surprise for you.” He led her off to the railing by the river. When she returned, she was all smiles.

“Such a gentleman,” she said, “he knows the way to a geek’s heart.”

“Well?” Claire demanded.

So Betsy told her. The reason why they were staying at the hotel instead of Sao Do is because the guest lodge had been gutted and transformed into a supercomputer facility. The arrays from Japan and India had been shipped over and hooked up, all 4000 quad CPUs. She had top level access to the facility.

“Better than anything I could get through the NSF,” Betsy concluded, “and a great mojito, too. Here’s to Lucy!” She lifted her glass and they all toasted.

Winston and Scratchy had spent a week relaxing in Kona before Jack’s jet picked them up and delivered them to Danang. Scratchy showed up at Ricardos wearing a tie-died hemp t-shirt and shorts, which sent Desi into fashion hysterics.

“You’re no better, Winston,” Desi said, his hands on his hips in a pretend huff. “Look at you there all dressed in Brooks Brothers. It must be 95 degrees out. You’ll both find some clothes I picked out for you in your hotel rooms.”

“I’m happy to see you, too, Lucy,” Scratchy said. “You serve alcohol in this joint? We’ve only been flying all fucking day.”

“Dear boy, you must be parched!” Desi led them to the bar.

Every Meister could link a chain of templates together given any one template as a starting point. But when Desi challenged the 108 Meisters to discover completely new templates, the results were not immediately positive. Another week went by with little to show.

“Maybe they are all nerds too,” he suggested to Scratchy, “and can’t think of anything else as important.”

They gathered together evenings upstairs at Ricardos in Desi’s apartment, with the windows open wide to the river breezes.

“I’m afraid we’re at an impasse,” Itchy said.

“You are assuming that the templates have arbitrary limits,” Jennifer replied. “I don’t accept that.”

“You got an alternative?” Scratchy said.

“We need to hook into some source of new template territory outside the Game,” Betsy said. “Maybe Constantine can help?”

“I’ve already been in contact with him,” Desi said, shaking his head. “He’s got nothing new to contribute.”

“It’s not as though the templates came out of thin air,” Claire added. “We’re looking for new ways of skilling. Who’s been writing about this?”

“We’ve covered the literature on multiple intelligences,” Alice said.

“There’s a book I heard about just recently,” Jennifer said. “Something about five skillings. It got a fabulous review in the Sunday Times a couple weeks back.”

§ § §

The very next morning, Jennifer woke up Desi, pounding on the back door of his apartment at sunrise.

“This is it!” she held up a USB stick as she strode to the center of the main room.

“Nothing is ‘it’ until I have a cup of coffee, deary.” Desi   sent her to the kitchen and excused himself to get dressed. He returned and she put a mug of highland-grown, Italian-roasted coffee in his hand.

The Five Skillings, she told him, as outlined in a series of books entitled Getting to Zero by Anjali, a psychotherapist in Montecito, are these: intellect, language, body, social, and internal voice.

“Sounds like psychotripe from the self-help section,” Desi said.

“Read the books and then you can be snide,” Jennifer said. “I’m going for a walk. I’ll meet you at the Tam Tam Cafe for breakfast.” She handed him the USB stick.

“You finish your homework?” Desi sat down in the rattan chair opposite hers. He leaned back, a smile blossomed. A waiter came up and set a ca phe sua nong and a fresh croissant in front of him. Desi thanked him.

“No, thank you, Grand Meister.” The waiter bowed and left.

“Templates cascade through these Skillings,” Jennifer said. “She captured these so well. We just need to tease them out...”

Desi nodded and spoke, “The Intellect is the home of curiosity and the province of memory. Language is the palace of poetry and the workshop of the mind. The Body is the first connection to the world. All other connections are built on the Body. The Internal Voice is the only friend we have at birth and death. It is the backstop for all other actions. The ability to exist alone, to be guided and comforted by one’s own philosophy, this is the primary skill that allows the individual to be social. Social skilling creates healthy boundaries and openings for intimacy with others.”

“You know, the author’s now a Sixer,” Jenn said. “I think she’ll make a great Meister at some point. Early this morning, I called her to meet me at the Sorbonne scene and we had a long conversation. She’s in full agreement about us using her work without restriction in the Game. The work was released with a Creative Commons license.”

“I really, really like her thoughts about unskilling the childhood defenses,” Desi said. “Before you can be skilled you need to become unskilled in the initial defense mechanisms that the child uses to cope. The Game has to help us remove the early tricks we used to get through our childhood so that we can learn a new set of skills for adulthood.”

“We tend to look for traumas, but most people are trapped by the successes they experience as infants.” Jennifer noted. “They learn to manipulate their parents and others and carry these skills into their adult lives. And the schools are no help at all.”

“The skills they put together as three-year-olds...” Desi said.

“...get in the way of acting in the world as adults.”

“So the answer is not to kill your parents, but rather to kill an infant that still runs your life. And that’s you.”

“Kill the infant, but keep the child within. If you have enough loving support as an infant, you enter childhood without the need for rigid coping skills. This means you are ready to cross over into adulthood as a teenager.”

“But if your parents are too busy...”

“...or too stressed,”

“...or too much controlled by their own internal infant,”

“...exactly. Then they end up raising infants instead of adults.”
