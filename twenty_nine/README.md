# Twenty Nine
Betsy was in Scratchy’s shower when his phone rang. Jack’s assistant was advising them be at the hotel pier in twenty minutes to catch a ride to le Grand Azure for breakfast.

“Be there soon as I wash the turtle,” Scratchy said and hung up, leaving Jack’s assistant to figure that out.

“Who was it?” Betsy called.

Scratchy stepped into the shower. “Breakfast on the yacht. Let me get your back.”

Fifteen minutes later they were on the dock, leaning out on the wooden rail, trying not to touch each other.

Winston came up behind them. “Doctor!”

“Doctor,” Scratchy turned and bowed. “Doctor.” He gestured at Betsy.

“Doctor!” Winston bowed.

“Doctor,” Betsy said, Doctor!” She pointed at Desi, stepping onto the dock.

“Doctor!” Winston said.

“No time for that. Look. Now there’s two of them in hemp!” Desi huffed. Betsy had borrowed Scratchy’s favorite hemp Fritz the Cat t-shirt. “It better not be catching!”

The Grand Meister was wearing a summer-weight linen Perry Ellis yachting ensemble and the Game hat.

“I usually don’t dress up for breakfast,” Betsy explained. “Thought I’d make an exception today.”

“Where did you get to last night?” Winston asked Scratchy.

“I’ll tell all on the boat.” Scratchy leaned over and whispered, “The trees have ears.”

Betsy waved at the Posse arriving as a group. Claire stole a long glance between her, Scratchy, and Scratchy’s t-shirt. She looked over at Alice who was grinning back at her. The two of them made sure Betsy was sitting between them on the launch, where they pounded her with questions. Jennifer and Desi split off to talk quietly. Winston cornered Scratchy in the bow.

“Guild of Guides,” he crowed. “Almost wish we had thought of it. Imagine! It’s like a new species.”

“You know the ending to that movie, the one where a new species takes over?” Scratchy kept glancing back at Betsy. She was fending off all questions with that glorious banter of hers.

A breakfast buffet had been laid on the top deck of Le Grand Azure. Jack greeted them as they took their food and sat down to eat.

“So, Michael...” he started, once they were all seated.

“Let him eat,” Alice said, “he must be exhausted!”

Betsy shot her a vicious look.

“Eat your omelette, then. The world will just have to wait.” Jack sat back.

“I’m sure Starbuck would like a piece of my bacon.” He looked around but didn’t spy the big manx cat.

Simon had to see Castalia, even if they drummed him out. His conversation with the Guild Master had given him a plan. He logged in and toggled third person. His avatar was dressed in the red cloak and it held the wooden staff in its right hand. Around him, curious Meisters were congregating. He toggled back to first person and made a bow. They returned it.

“I am Simon, of Eldrick the Dark Mage,” he spoke. “Many of you know me.”

“Are you really a Grand Meister?” someone asked.

“The Game has determined this is so. Is Grand Meister Desi in Castalia?”

A call went through the throng. There was no reply.

“We have no time to lose.” He stepped up to the central dais and gestured to the assembled Meisters. “Now we will strike back at those who have stolen our Game.”

§ § §

After he pushed back his plate and drained the last of his triple latte, Scratchy told them everything Michelle had said, except for the point about the Meisters. He was saving that. Betsy jumped in to add her concerns about the potential unintended consequences of the existence of the Guild of Guides.

“There’s no getting around this,” she warned. “Michelle is not a god, but in her arena, in the Internet, she has more godlike powers than anything we’ve seen on this planet to date. She can be anywhere and everywhere on the planet. She can alter any information on any database. Erase histories, eliminate identities...”

“Mix some radical techno,” Scratchy added. “Compose poetry never before contemplated, find cures for diseases, broker peace agreements, set off global thermonuclear war. We get the idea.”

“As far as we know, the Guides are still constrained by their original programming and the learning they acquired through the templates,” Itchy said.

Jennifer stood and went over to the rail, looking back to the beach and the highland mountains shrouded in a perpetual haze. Something tugged at her mind. She began to walk down the deck, tantalized by a realization just outside her grasp.

“So there might be a limiting boundary between what they can do and what they might?” Jack asked the table. “We need to find this.”

“You made the Game Intention-full,” Claire said, “Do we have any reason to think that Michelle has escaped this original intention?”

Itchy and Desi insisted that while there was no way to simply turn off the Guides now that their software was not Game-based, there was certainly a potential to hack the software. Scratchy reminded them of Michelle’s retaliation threats. Jack argued for a new form of computer hardware that could block the mesh and slowly wean the world away from the Guild.

Jennifer returned from her stroll. She stood at the end of the table with her hands flat on its top. Excitement animated her face as she waited for Jack to pause. They all turned to her.

“Jenn’s got the answer, Jack,” Desi said. “Can’t you see? She’s got that Scratchy-gonna-tell-us-how-things-work look.”

Jack sat back and gestured for her to begin.

“Governance has not been well modeled by the templates,” she started. “Not yet. Not until about ten minutes ago. Not until I unfolded the interpellation template another six levels. It turns out Haberdas was right about one thing.” She paused. Using words to explain templates was always a challenge.

“You know, he’s a Meister,” Desi whispered to Itchy. “Haberdas. I saw him in Castalia last month arguing with Geddens.”

Jennifer sighed. “Once you Query this new structure it will all become absolutely clear.”

“I don’t Query,” Betsy said. “And I don’t do funny hand movements. So give it to me in English.”

“I’ll try. If you unify practical, moral, and aesthetic reason, you can rebuild the basis for democracy into a form of structured conversation. We can use Castalia as a conversational body, a Senate. We can legitimate the Meisters as a meritocractic voice for the Game, and build a completely template driven juridical role for the Guild to play. This will give them a clear limit to their actions.”

“You have a name for this new template structure?” Desi asked.

“I call it ‘Gouvernementalité’,” she said. “What’s that in English?”

“Governmentality,” Alice said. “One of my favorite ‘F’ words.”

“So the Guild are the police for the Meisters?” Scratchy asked. “How come I don’t get all warm and fuzzy when I hear that?”

“We charge the Meisters to build laws from the templates,” Jenn retorted. “That way the Meisters are also bound by their need to make the laws intention-full. This removes most of the arbitrary consequences of their power.”

“Any new law can be appealed to the Grand Meister, who will determine if it violates a template.” She looked over at Desi. “The Grand Meister becomes Chief Justice. It’s so simple!”

“Way too much talkie, talkie going on here!” Desi stood and put his hands on his hips. “Who died and made us the Continental Congress?”

Claire spoke up. “I don’t think Jenn expects that we can figure this out right now, right here. Personally, I’d need to Query these new templates before any decision. Just to get things straight. We are talking about governing the Game? Right? It’s not like we are setting up our own country...”

“My point is this. We get the Meisters to make laws based on the templates. The Guild executes the laws...” Jenn said.

“...Or the lawbreakers.” Jack scowled.

“...The Guild is given power and purpose and precise limits,” Jenn continued, unfazed. “If they accept this role, then we have fundamentally decreased the uncertainty in all our futures. There’s just one thing more.”

She looked around the table. “The way I read the template structure, it also seems to call for an external veto capability. Somebody outside the system who can monitor decisions that might be driven by self interest. I was considering Jack...”

“Flattered I am, too,” Jack said. “Only, I’ve got so many other enterprises to chase.” He had been advocating damage control, but this new tack pushed the problem into brighter relief. What if the Game can be transformed into a model state? What’s more modern than a state without a territory? He said, “I think that’s why Michelle turned to Michael. And I would suggest that Michael continue in this role.”

“Mikey’s got my vote for King,” Desi said.

“When I hear the word ‘Governmentality’ I reach for my gun,” Scratchy grumbled. “All I need from you guys is some perspective on whether or not we should turn the game back on.”

“Can we talk the Guild into this role?” Claire asked.

“Probably easier than convincing Scratchy to be King,” Betsy said. They made eye contact and he shrugged.

“I would bet that when we insert the new Governmentality templates into the Game, the Guides will learn them and come to the same conclusions. And the Game will also teach these to the Meisters,” Jennifer concluded.

“That means we have to restart the Game. There is no other choice,” Jack said.

“Are you all agreed?” Scratchy asked, looking around at them. Everyone nodded solemnly.

The four explosions, nearly simultaneous, actually lifted the yacht a good two feet. Whump! Whump! Whump! Whump! Way down somewhere below the waterline, too enormous not to be fatal to the craft. Their chairs left the deck and everything floated for a split second before the whole world crashed back. Physically ejected from their seats, the group was picking themselves off the deck up when the klaxon horn began to wail.

Jack staggered to a nearby wall, where he grabbed a phone from its cradle. He listened briefly.

“All right.” His voice betrayed nothing but concern. “Make sure nobody is left behind.” He replaced the phone.

“Life-vests, everyone!” The loudspeaker crackled. “Away all craft. Launch all lifeboats. Abandon ship. Abandon ship. This is no drill!”

Jack flipped open a bench and started pulling out life-vests. Claire and Alice passed these along to everyone in sight. Over at the railing a crew member launched a lifeboat. The seven-foot capsule ejected with a gunshot blast from its clamps and broke open as it played out a tether. The rubber raft billowed red as it self-inflated. By the time it hit the water it was self righting into a covered round boat. The crewman dove in after it, surfaced, stroked a few times to grab at its tether, and detached this. He waved back at them.

“Over the side,” Jack yelled. He moved to the railing and opened a gate.

Turning, he surveyed the scene. Across the various decks, the crew were launching the boats le Grand Azure carried: the sailboat, motor launch, speed boats, Zodiacs, and a fleet of the emergency life boat capsules. Up front, the helicopter whined to life and prepared to lift off. Crew members jumped from the upper decks or just waded from the lower decks, now awash. The top deck was trembling, the surrounding waters boiled, but the ship remained upright.

Jack helped Betsy to the opening in the rail. She looked back.

“Where’s Scratchy?”

“He’ll be right behind you,” Jack said. “Go on now.”

She jumped the 15 feet to the water below. Jennifer stepped up behind her at the rail. Jack took her arm.

“I think we lost Scratchy,” she stated. Jack looked around.

“Christ. Where did he go to?”

“He ran in there.” She pointed at the day salon. Jack made to start in that direction, but she held him.

“Alice went after Scratchy. She’ll take care of him.”

She stepped to the other side of the opening and caught hold of Claire’s wrist.

“It’s just a little jump. Jack, give her a hand.”

Jack stepped up and took her other arm.

Winston stepped up behind her. “I’ll be next. Meet you at the life raft.” He squeezed her shoulder.

Down below, Betsy waved as she clung to the side of the life raft, bobbing in the chop. The crew member helped her climb inside. Claire jumped and surfaced, sputtering. Jack and Jennifer then helped everyone else on deck jump down to safety. Jack kept glancing back at the salon door.

“Fucking hippy!” he cursed under his breath. “Stupid goddamn geek...” The Captain came up to him.

“Crew is all accounted for.”

“Thank you, Captain.” The water was now only seven feet from the deck.

“Alice will take care of him,” Jennifer said again. “I know that girl.”

“Your turn.” He took her arm.

Jennifer stepped from the deck.

“Captain,” Jack said.

“Count Ottavio, after you. I must insist.”

“Last man to abandon ship.”

“Something like that.”

“I certainly hope so.” Jack said and jumped.

§ § §

“Are you insane!” Alice ran after Scratchy, who had suddenly ducked into the day salon instead of going to the railing with everyone else.

“Go back,” he said and then yelled. “Starbuck!”

He moved with unexpected speed across the large room to a pantry.

“Starbuck! Where the fuck are you?”

He glanced about, peering into corners and hidden nooks in the built-in furnishings.

“Come on!” she urged. “Everyone is abandoning ship.”

“I’m not leaving without Jack’s manx.”

“Starbuck!” he yelled. “Come out!”

“A cat!” She looked around her feet. “This is about a cat?”

“If he’s not here, I know where he is.”

Alice gripped his arm and turned him to face her.

“We should go.”

“You go.” He tore his arm free.

“Fuck that.”

“Then help me.”

“Two minutes and we’re over the side.” She took him by the shoulders and stared into his eyes. “You agree, or I will bitch slap the living shit out of you.”

“In that case, OK.” He grinned. “Let’s go!”

He caught the forward door and opened it. Ahead was passageway and a staircase. He ran down the stairs, she followed.

“Down?” she said. “Down is wrong. Up is where we need to go!”

“Two minutes! Come on!”

They hit the deck below and Stratchy moved forward. The lights flickered and died, enveloping them in complete darkness. A miasma of diesel fumes, acrid smoke, and ash particles hung in the air. It smelled like slow death.

The emergency lights cut in. Water was circling their shoes.

“One fucking minute left!” she said.

“Here it is.” They reached a large double door. Scratchy grabbed the handle and tugged.

“It’s locked!” He looked around.

“Going we are!” she yelled and pointed. “Back up that way!”

“Thirty seconds,” he said, spying an axe in a holder on the wall.

He tore the axe from the wall and returned to the door.

“Wait!” she yelled. “Give me that.” Her hand found the handle. “I’ve always wanted to do this.”

“OK.” He let loose.

She stepped up, and took a great swing. The axe head bit into the wood above the lock. She freed it and swung again. This time the head went clean through where the doors met. She twisted the axe and leveraged the doors open. A dark form came cannon-balling out of the room. It made a line through Scratchy’s legs. He ducked and grabbed it up.

“Starbuck!”

He held the cat up. Starbuck meowed and shook the water off his forepaws. The emergency lights failed and darkness blossomed around them.

Alice had stepped into the enormous private suite. At a glance she made a decision.

“This way!” She stepped forward. “This way or we drown. And put a blanket around that cat.”

Ahead was a sliding glass door, streaming sunlight. Now semi-submerged, it led to a balcony. Sea water forced through the door jamb. Scratchy held the cat by its neck scruff and belly. He took one hand away, grabbed up a blanket, and wrapped it around the feline.

“Got to leave,” he said. Seawater flowed around his thighs.

Now, the glass door was half submerged. Alice grabbed the handle and flipped open the latch.

“Stand back!” She opened the door a crack and the water forced it wide. Scratchy had moved to the wall on one side of the door, and Alice backed to the wall on the other side. A tsunami of water washed into the room, carrying away the furnishings. By the time the initial rush subsided the room was rapidly filling with water.

Scratchy held the struggling cat over his head. Alice came around behind him. She put her hands under his shoulders and guided and then pushed him, head down, out the door.

They surfaced outside the ship as the top deck began to disappear in the waves. Scratchy treaded water furiously, holding up the cat, still wrapped in the blanket. Alice swam up behind him and put her shoulder under his. Her powerful legs pushed them both up to where Scratchy could lower his arms a bit without soaking the now-hysterical Starbuck.

Starbuck, howling his fear, twisted around and reached for Scratchy’s head. All the claws from one paw attached to Scratchy’s forehead, while the other paw dug into his ear. Scratchy howled as loud as the cat.

Alice almost missed the noise of the outboard motor on Jack’s Zodiak as it bore down on their position from the side. She turned to it as it settled to a stop. A crew member leaned over, took hold of both of Starbuck’s black furry forelegs, and yanked the cat, blanket and all, off the sputtering, blubbering Scratchy. He glanced up to see the rubber gunwale of the bow of the Zodiak looming over his head.

Still treading, Alice turned Scratchy by the arm so they were face to face. Blood flowed from his ear and forehead, down into his eyes.

“Time’s up,” he said, blinking.

“You fucking idiot,” she laughed, and dunked him, and then yanked him up, with his head in both hands. She kissed him hard on his cheek and gave him a rough embrace.

“Can we get in the boat now,” he choked.

“You first, Ishmael.”

“I should make you swim to shore!” Jack leaned over the gunwale. “Disobeying the Captain’s orders. That’s a keelhauling offense. Give me your hand.”

Jack grabbed Scratchy’s extended hand and pulled. Scratchy grunted and hardly moved. With her left hand, Alice grabbed the running line attached to the Zodiak. With the other hand she reached down and found one of Scratchy’s ass cheeks. On Jack’s cue he pulled and she boosted him. Scratchy emerged from the water like a hemp-wrapped sea lion and slumped forward into the boat, rolling on the bottom.

“Jack, is Betsy OK?” Scratchy gasped, rasping for air.

“Everyone is fine, now,” Jack said and bent over to help Alice.

Instead, Alice took hold of the rope with both hands. She dipped, scissor kicked, and yanked simultaneously. In one easy motion she twisted mid air and ended up sitting on the gunwale, supple as a dolphin. She shifted her legs around to enter the boat and shook the sea out her hair.

Jack looked over at Jennifer, who held Starbuck shivering in the blanket. She winked back at him and then looked past him. He turned to see the top mast of le Grand Azure sink into the bay.

“Bastards took my boat!” he spat. Then he did a very un-Jack thing. He looked up at the sky, up where some Intelsat satellite was doubtlessly recording this mission in high definition, and fired off a classic Rockefeller salute.

Desi left Itchy programming the new Governmentality templates in the Room and logged into Castalia, which was buzzing with activity. The place was as crowded as a Burning Guy playa after dark. Up ahead on the central dais a dense crowd of Meisters were gathered. Somewhere in the middle of the crowd, he could make out the top of a staff. He glanced over at his own staff. They were identical.

He reached the edge of the crowd and the Meisters took notice and gave him a path into the center, where a young Meister flourished a staff while he gave out a stream of instructions. Desi’s first thought was that some young hacker had managed to trick the Game into giving him Grand Meister status, but the young man looked up at him and simply bowed. He looked oddly familiar. Desi stepped up in front of him. The crowd fell silent.

“Congratulations,” Desi said and bowed back. “What is your name?”

“I am Simon of Eldrick, the Dark Mage,” Simon said. “Glad you could make it. Want to hear what we’re planning?” Simon’s face showed the trace of a smile.

On a large console beside Simon a global map showed a myriad of red lights.

“I think first we should complete our introductions in private,” Desi gestured at the stairway leading to the top of the Castalia tower.

“Everyone continue to register your missions with local committees,” Simon said to the crowd. He moved toward the stairway, pounding his staff on the flagstone as he walked. Desi followed. While his avatar was walking Desi phoned Itchy and asked him to check on the current number of Meisters in Castalia.

“One hundred and seventy-four Meisters, and... woah!”

“What?”

“Two Grand Meisters! You’ve got company.”

“Tell me about it!”

“I’ve got the profile on the other one,”

“Go ahead.”

“His name is Simon Bishop. He’s just seventeen. He has a twin brother, Peter, who is a Fiver. His Guide is named Eldrick...”

“...the Dark Mage. Is that it? He’s only seventeen? Good god, he must have been living the Game for the past three years.”

“Check this out. His father is Reverend Gerry Bishop, the guy who took credit for bringing down the Game.”

“Mission accomplished, Mr. President,” said Karl. “They’ll think twice about hacking into Unana. I’ll have the satellite photos for you in the morning.”

“Took out their entire yacht? Fuckin’ A, all right! Who is this Count Ottavio?” W. G. chuckled and took a pull on a beer. “You don’t say. What’s a fellow like him tied up with a gang of rogue nerds?”

He listened. “Well, I’ve got some weight to throw around, too. Put him on the terror suspect list. Let him know we’re payin’ attention to his ass. He won’t bother us much.”

He listened some more. “Shit, Karl. What I know about information technology you can fit in this beer can. But if the RIND folks think we should be running this thing, then I’m goin’ to sign us up. It’s my responsibility to get our economy back on track.”
