**Policy and Procedure 3.1 - Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) Accounting Policies and Procedures**
===========================================================================================================

A.  Basis of Accounting

    a.  Policy: The organization uses the accrual basis of accounting.
        > The accrual basis is the method of accounting whereby revenue
        > and expenses are identified with specific periods of time,
        > such as a month or year, and are recorded as incurred. This
        > method of recording revenue and expenses is without regard to
        > date of receipt or payment of cash.

    b.  Procedure:

        i.  Throughout the fiscal year, expenses are accrued into the
            > month in which they are incurred. The books are closed no
            > later than the 15th of the month after the close of
            > the month. Invoices received after closing the books will
            > be counted as a current-month expense.

        ii. At the close of the fiscal year, this rule is not enforced.
            > All expenses that should be accrued into the prior fiscal
            > year, are so accrued, in order to ensure that year-end
            > financial statements reflect all expenses incurred during
            > the fiscal year. Year-end books are closed no later than
            > 90 days after the end of the fiscal year.

        iii. Revenue is always recorded in the month in which it was
            > earned or pledged.

B.  Reconciliations

    a.  Policy: All bank and credit card statements will be opened and
        > reviewed in a timely manner. Reconciliation and approval will
        > occur within 30 days of the close of the month.

    b.  Procedures:

        i.  Monthly statements are reviewed by the Finance Manager, who
            > then submits them to a third party bookkeeper
            > for reconciliation. The bookkeeper communicates to the
            > Finance Manager any discrepancies, and reports back the
            > results of the reconciliations.

C.  Security

    a.  Access to online banking and credit card accounts is restricted
