# Section Three: The Five Skillings   -Twenty Five
With more than three-hundred advanced Gamers in the Town, everybody had a lot to talk about, although the Fivers tended to stick together, and the Sixers were just stuck-up. There were even a few Meisters, but they were busy with some project they couldn’t talk about. A lot of the resident Gamers also worked in the Town: in the restaurants, the gym, the office, the baths, or in maintenance. All workers got an additional discount at the restaurants. Megan was on the list to become a barista in the GameTown Red Star.

The baths in the basement of the GameTown were intimidating at first, but then she relaxed and discovered that chatting in the tubs was easy and fun even with strangers. The staff had to explain about washing up and rinsing off before getting into the tubs, but then it all made perfect sense.

Yesterday, her Guide, Bobby, showed up in Junana and they talked for like five hours straight. All Fivers, Sixers, and Meisters could now talk to their Guides in Junana. GameTowns across the planet buzzed with new excitement. Bobby was hurt that Megan didn’t go to Sao Do. She could be helping the Grand Meister reinvent the Game. What did he mean by that? She asked. But he wouldn’t say.

Level Five was a complete biotch. She was getting nowhere. Without Bobby, it seemed like a whole different experience. Level Five is more difficult than the other four levels combined, Bobby explained. That’s why only one in an million gets through it. Like that was going to make her feel better. Level Six is, Bobby said, even harder, which is why people who complete it are truly Meisters. Only one person has made it through Level Seven. Megan began to feel that  everything she learned in the Game made her less capable of understanding how the world could have gotten so completely screwed up. The world outside the Game read like some dark Bruce Sterling post-apocalyptic novel. Wars in the Middle East, global warming, orange alerts, fear-fuelled news, instant celebrity drivel. Who was going to fix all of that? The Game is all about questions. Who has the answers?

After consulting with the Nerds and the Posse, Jennifer and Desi called all of the Meisters to Castalia, where they outlined the Five Skillings. They stood in the middle of the central square surrounded by dozens of avatars.

“The Internal Voice is the voice of reflection and reason, the quiet whisper of philosophy and wonder that each individual needs to cultivate to be successfully alone,” Desi told them, in what would later be called “The Sermon of the Skillings.”

“If you cannot be successfully alone, you can never be successfully social,” Jennifer continued. “Learn to be your own teacher, friend, and critic. This skill is central to life. Here is where Intention-full promotes reflexive awareness.

“Language is the key to meaning. The meaning you build in your life will be expressed through language. It is the province of the poetic and the sword of the intellect. Here is where Intention-full promotes comprehension.” She nodded to Desi, who took up her line of reasoning.

“The Intellect is where you learn to be curious and critical. Here is where Intention-full promotes understanding. This is the engine for education and one of the two vehicles for status. The other is the Body. The Body is the first point of attachment you have to the surrounding world. All of the rest of the attachments to the world depend on your skilling with and through the body. When you walk down the street, sing karaoke, or stroke the thigh of your lover, you are an embodied being. Here is where Intention-full promotes virtuosity and playfulness.” He nodded back at her.

“All of the other four arenas of skilling come into force in the Social. Skilling in the Social is all about boundaries: knowing when and where to be open or closed to the intentions of others. Skilling in Language and the Body gives you the clues you need to interpret the meanings and the desires of those around you. Skilling in the Internal Voice affords you a critical distance from the social world. Skilling in the Intellect gives you capital to spend in society. Here is where Intention-full promotes intimacy.” She stopped.

“We need to move ahead with the next version of the Game.” Desi walked among the Meisters, who dipped their heads in deference. “If we don’t start to get results in a week, we will shut down the Game.” He paused for effect.

“Everybody needs to redouble their efforts. Please. Right now you’re the Game’s only hope.” The Five Skillings talk was recorded and played continuously in Castalia as Meisters checked in across the planet.

The first new template arrived 18 hours later. Within four days they had capstone templates for three of the five Skillings. The Meisters readily pushed these through their entire unfolding structures. The teams at Sao Do wove these into the Intention-full framework for Level Two. Wanda and Jorge were hired to video a Body skilling class based on the work of Master Lu, a Chinese kung fu and acupuncture practitioner from Hong Kong whose methods were suggested by several Meisters. The Lu workout would be a third training all Level Two players took. It required an inflated ball the size of a cantaloupe. Jack made these available at all Red Star Coffee houses. Within two weeks the Meisters had ferreted out the template structures for Internal Voice and the Social.

The Sao Do village compound became the default test bed for Version 2.0. Sao Do Gamers tackled the new Level Two. Over the next several weeks, Desi watched for signs of change. The first thing he noticed was music. When he walked through the complex, the apartments were bursting with song, from recordings or people practicing instruments.  The next thing was the compound bulletin board. Instead of the usual used-furniture sales, he noticed postings for events and requests for spaces to practice. The compound store sold out of art supplies one week, and Desi ordered up a whole catalog of paper, ink, paint, brushes, clay, and canvas from Hanoi. He arranged for the main hall to be open and available for performances and rehearsals every evening. He emailed Jack, who preloaded new kiosks at the GameTowns with artist supplies.

The next step was to get all of the Meisters on board with the new Level Two training. This proved more eventful than Desi had hoped.

“What do you mean, we have to learn these new templates,” shouted one of the more outspoken 15-year-olds, dressed in a forest green wizard robe. “What’s the point of becoming a Meister if somebody can tell us what to do?” This sent the assembly into a frenzy of heated conversation. Desi looked around and noticed that the great majority of the Meisters were not yet of legal drinking age. He was about to say it was for their own good, but stopped himself. Instead, he pulled rank.

“What’s your name?” he asked.

“I am Simon, of the Dark Mage Eldrick,” the lad replied.

“Well, Simon of the Dark Mage Eldrick, whoever that is, when you become a Grand Meister, nobody can tell you what you need to do. Until then, you and all the Meisters will volunteer to go through Level Two and pick up the templates for the Five Skillings. Only then will you be allowed back into Castalia.” For effect, he thumped the base of his staff on the marble plinth where he stood. This echoed convincingly.

“If we are to be leaders of the Game,” Desi called out, “We need to be its keepers. I’m going back to Level Two, and I will see all of you here in Castalia when we master these new templates!” Desi logged out of Castalia into the Room.

“Who murdered your cat?” Itchy asked him from the console. Desi’s avatar had been storming around the perimeter of the Room, waving his staff.

“I’m not sure Castalia was such a great idea. The Meisters are a gang of petulant infants.”

“Many of them don’t even drive a car yet,” Itchy said, “but they are what the Game is all about.”

“Have you finished programming the new requirements for level advancement?” Desi asked.

“In the testing queue right now, to be implemented overnight. This will take everyone, including Grand Meisters, back to Level Two for regrooving.”

“Adios Nerdville!” Desi said.

For their investment, the Reverend Gerry Bishop had requested and received the right to put his UCCC cathedral at the top of each and every Junana Plaza, all one thousand of them. The RIND designers asked him how big and he told them, “Big as anything on the planet. Big as that Papist monstrosity in Rome. Big enough for ten thousand with plenty of elbow room.”

Gerry had always admired the Duomo di Sienna. He had been dazzled by the whole confusion of romanesque and early gothic elements, the black and white pillars, the mosaics on the floors, the overwhelming confection of the architecture. He had the RIND nerd team use the plans for this and their ultra-high-resolution imagery and simply boosted the size up to a million cubic meters. Working with the RIND digital artists, he inserted his favorite Norman Rockwell-esque images into the stained glass, jettisoned the Catholic bric-a-brac, and inserted transporters into every column.

Gerry’s pulpit was reworked in black marble and the lighting made him completely visible even from the narthex. His avatar was a larger, slimmer, younger version of himself. A battalion of angels, based on the Wanda and Jorge avatars, dressed in tasteful white robes with the cutest white feathery wings all tucked back, led each worshipper to her seat. As soon as a player’s avatar entered the space they could sing any song in the hymnal. Bishop would record a new service every Saturday and this would play on alternate hours for the next two days. The flow of Junana bucks into the offering plates alone could bring in fifty million Euros a month.

Outside the UCCC cathedrals, all of the new Junana was commercial property: a thousand splendid shopping malls, each of them larger than anything on the planet. Players could buy all their virtual clothing, jewelry, vehicles, apartments, entertainments, and other goods using the Game currency, which was convertible with all major world currencies. Physical copies of many of the virtual goods could be delivered overnight.

When they first logged in, players were given a suit of white underwear for modesty. Every player got a personal shopping guide for Junana. Promotions were also georeferenced to stores within a mile of the player’s location. Helpful advertisements popped up in the visual range of the player when she arrived at Junana.com. The consortium purchased the domain name “Unana.com” as the URL for the new service.

Media, sport, and music celebrity figures circulated, chatted with players, and offered promotional deals for events and upcoming TV specials.

All that was missing were the players. The RIND Corporation kept announcing internally that they expected to hack the code within days. After six months of that, Gerry stopped the next payment on the Church’s investment. He got a call from Harold the next morning.

“Reverend Bishop,” said Harold. “Is there any way I can answer your concerns?”

“Stop jerking my chain and get me those billion worshippers you promised. Soon as you do that, you’ll see the rest of our cash.”

“Your cathedrals turned out...splendidly,” Harold said, amazed how an astonishing lack of taste on an unprecedented scale can result in something so hideous it achieves a kind of sick greatness.

“I need to see butts in those pews. Good bye, Harold.”

Some later called it “The Year of the Five Skillings,” although it was closer to ten months. It was the last coherent interlude of the first great wave of the Game. Junana had hit its saturation limit in the global population, pushed flush against the digital divide. There were not enough Computos and cell phones to reach the billions on the other side. On this side of the divide, almost everyone probably knew about Junana and most had accounts. A majority had at least tasted the Game, and most of these had made it to Level Two.

With all the advanced players and their Guides back at Level Two, picking up the new templates for the Skillings, the entire planet seemed to be breathing in unison. The Skillings blossomed in a thousand different manners across the globe. But the impact on the players was roughly similar from Lagos to Los Angeles.

The first reaction was often chagrin, something of an indulgence. The Guides would say, “How can you feel bad that you didn’t know something that was only made available now?” The next reaction was usually fascination as the Intellect is the Home of Curiosity template learning kicked in. Master Lu had noted that it takes a full eight weeks for any new skilling to settle into the body, and so the five Skillings were designed to be digested over a space of forty weeks. Of course, becoming adept at any of the Skillings was a life-long effort. That was the entire point. One got better at it.

The Red Star factories in Danang manufactured hundreds of millions of Master Lu’s Body Balls, those melon-sized inflated balls that were the all the equipment needed for the Body is the First Connection template workout, again with an instructional video led by Jorge and Wanda under Master Lu’s direction. The balls were shipped to all the Red Star Coffee outlets for distribution. Each player’s Guide announced what the price would be, based on the player’s finances. The payment was made on the honor system. The monies collected eventually covered all the costs. In many locations across the planet most balls were given away free. Jack was entirely satisfied by this arrangement, and the Sao Do crews implemented it for all the other clothing in the Game, which was now stocked and made available directly through 7000 Red Star Coffee outlets.

The third reaction to the Skillings was an interlude of silence, a gigantic collective global in-breath as hundreds of millions of players began to monitor their internal voice. Even the Guides fell silent here, knowing their voices did not matter. The template structure for this skilling had been unfolded by a young female Meister from a small village in the desert of Namibia, whose internal voice had saved her even before she found the Game. Her Guide, Annaline, was so very proud of her, as were the students in her new school.

The lasting reaction to the Skillings, and the desired outcome, was an irresistible impulse for conversation and a growing desire to play. Play, in this sense, harkens back to its original sense, preserved in “swordplay” and “wordplay”; that is, the exercise of a skill, the ability to wield an object, a thought, or a phrase in a manner better than one did yesterday. As the original Game was Intention-full, the newly expanded Game could only be described as play-full.

Peter had never seen Simon so angry, not even when their father tossed away Simon’s D&D deck.

“Nobody disses the Dark Mage,” Simon kept ranting, throwing whatever he could get his hands on.

After that Simon locked himself in his dorm room and hardly ever came out. He skimmed the Haverbrook KayAye lessons, zoomed through the Five Skillings without seeming to learn any of them as far as Peter could tell. He did the minimum needed to get back to Level Seven and then cloistered himself inside the task of mastering the Game.

For Peter the skillings opened up a world outside the church and school, a place filled with music and conversation. He picked up a digital drum set and was getting pretty good at it. Most of the students were Gamers. Rector Hector retreated to his apartments, venturing out furtively for chapel. Some of the faculty used the KayAye in defiance of policy. The school van took students into town three afternoons a week. Courtney introduced him to Anthony, a Haverbrook sophomore learning guitar.

Together, their Guides introduced them to some town girls. Tiffanie and Roxy, who played keyboard and bass. Their band practiced in Roxy’s garage. Tiffanie let Peter kiss her and he held her breast through her t-shirt and bra. Courtney advised him that Tiffanie was a better band member than a girl friend. She had not earned her shoes. Still, a kiss and a feel were better than nothing, which what what he was getting as a Haverbrook dork.

Peter asked Courtney to ask Simon’s Guide if everything were all right with him. Eldrick reported to Courtney that Simon was close to the end of Level Seven and had chosen not to be disturbed. Peter tried to digest this information. It made no sense to him. Nobody finishes Level Seven except a Grand Meister.
