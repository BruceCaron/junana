# Thirty One
“He’s a brilliant lad,” Desi said. They were all gathered in the Sao Do compound conference room. The compound now was guarded by Vietnamese military police and protected by the Vietnamese secret service. “A might abrasive. Perhaps a bit broken. Reminds me of someone.” He glanced over at Scratchy.

“It’s hardly original: ‘Today the Earth Stands Still.’ What kind of action is that?” Betsy said. “It’s just protest on a new scale.”

“He claims that the protest is incidental, what he’s accomplishing is the process. The protest will be planet-wide, but each location is determining its own mission, and each mission promotes individual action,” Desi replied. “He says we can reuse the process for other actions.”

“So a billion Gamers will be out on the street simultaneously across the planet,” Scratchy said. “That’s a good trick if he pulls it off. Kinda’ hard to ignore.”

“It’s not technically simultaneous, he’s going for Noon in each time zone. Bigger local impact that way,” Jennifer noted.

“By the time this hits California, everybody is going to be looking out for it,” Claire said. “Are we still on for Mardi Gras?” She looked over at Jack.

“We can’t sit here under guard forever,” Jack said. “We can stop off in Santa Barbara for the day of the Strike and then go to New Orleans for the reopening of the Game. Tad’s got us cabins at the Ranch.”

“You can steal your own robe,” Scratchy said to Desi.

The Strike mission on Sunday at noon in Kiritimati comprised of 14 kids on bicycles racing from one end of London Town to the other. This was the most excitement to hit this mid-Pacific Island since the British set off a hydrogen bomb on the atoll in the 1950s. It was the first of thousands of collective missions to occur on Strike day.

As noon rolled across the planet cities began to shut down. The most common individual action was simply to stop in traffic. In every urban locale, thousands of cars and trucks suddenly halted on the roads and highways. On the sidewalks, millions of pedestrians halted mid stride at the stroke of noon. In many cities the only thing moving were phalanxes of naked bicyclists braving the winter chill to add a surreal highlight for the news cameras.

In a hundred cities, mural mobs gathered in the underpasses to paint vivid scenes in fifteen minutes. Impromptu overpass orchestras emerged from cars parked on freeways. Choruses congealed in city parks, their voices rising above the sudden stillness of the street. Uplooker mobs on street corners caused millions of passersby to stop and stare at the sky. Kissing throngs coupled on train station platforms, whispering tearful farewells as they blocked the passageways. On the subways of the world, naked was the rule as millions shucked their trousers and skirts at noon.

The news of these events galloped across Europe and then the Atlantic as cities in the Americas braced for the arrival of high noon.

“This is better than a de Broca movie,” Scratchy said. After breakfast at the San Jacinto Ranch they were gathered in Jack’s suite to watch NNC’s coverage of the day. The show was recapping the Strike’s impact in Asia. On screen ten thousand couples in formal evening wear danced a waltz on Tiananmen square. “Do we know what’s up for Santa Barbara?”

“The local mission committee plans to shut down the cross streets to have a naked bicycle race down State Street to the beach,” Desi said.

“The ranch has a fleet of bicycles,” Betsy offered.

“I must have glitter!” Desi cried.

They all looked at Jack, who had settled back with his hands crossed over his chest.

“I’m not your father. You can do whatever you want.”

“Somehow, I don’t think Jack knows he’s a member of the Posse,” Winston looked over at Alice, who was seated next to one of the plates of doughnuts Claire had ordered up. Alice caught his look and nodded. She picked up a doughnut covered with confectioner’s sugar and walked up to Jack. An innocent smile disguised her intentions.

“I hereby brand you a member in good standing of the Posse.” She moved to pop him in the forehead. Remarkably, Jack swept his hand up and deflected the pastry. He reached out with his other hand and grabbed up a doughnut from a plate nearby. In the same motion he shagged this at Winston, who ducked back. The pastry hit Jennifer square on the cheek. The ensuing battle raged until all the doughnuts were in crumbs and laughter had sent most of them to the floor.

President W. G. Stone sat alone in the Oval Office watching Freddy Earl interview some academic expert about the anarchy that had erupted across the planet. His Presidential briefing on the events had been thorough and revealing. Somehow or other, Gerry Bishop’s own son had run this global terrorist attack out of that private school in North Carolina. A federal indictment would be forthcoming as soon as they could figure out the charges.

The very thought of 5000 naked Frisbee players on the National Mall had sent Arlene into one of her migraines. Then there was the news about little Simon Bishop, who had visited them right here in the oval office not three years ago. Even worse, the Vice President’s secret squad over at homeland security had been unable to gain any kind of intelligence on W. G.’s missing assets. His private phone rang.

“Yes.” He spoke into the receiver. “Who? What? His boat? That’s none of my business. This is my private line, you know better than...What? My money? All right, put him on.”

“President Stone,” said Jack.

“Count Ottavio,” said W. G. “What do you know about this theft?”

“As we speak, these funds are being transfered to a place where you can claim them.”

“That’s what I wanted to hear. How are you involved?”

“I’m just the messenger, although I’d like to claim some of the funds to pay for my yacht.”

“I don’t know anything about any yacht. Where’s my money?”

“As I said, you can walk in and claim every penny. It’s being held at the International Court of Justice.” Jack let that idea settle in and waited in silence for a good minute.

“The what?”

“The World Court in The Hague.”

“That’s in Europe. I want my money back in the bank, pronto, or I’ll have your balls for breakfast.” W. G. gesticulated at the empty room.

“You are not to only person with a claim to these assets. The Court has a sealed list of every transaction involved in assembling these assets.”

“List? There is no list.”

“Believe me when I say this list is authoritative and comprehensive. As soon as you make a claim for the funds, the Court will unseal the list. Until then the Court has been given the right to draw upon interest from the assets for administering this case. You are currently their prime benefactor.”

“You’ll pay for this, Ottavio. I don’t care where you hide.”

“Did I forget to tell you?”

“Tell me what?”

“You must make the claim in person.”

“In The Hague? You’ve got to be joking.”

“You have Air Force One at your command. Holland is closer than Hawaii.”

“Why am I talking to you? Who’s in charge?”

“I’m certain you two will meet. She wanted to tell you herself, but gave me this small favor. By the way, tell Karl that the Game will be back up tomorrow at the stroke of midnight. And I have a message for him from Michael O’hara.”

“I’m not Karl’s secretary.” W. G. slammed down the receiver.

“Goddamn Europeans! Goddamn European courts!”

He picked up the internal White House phone. “Get me the VP. Now!”

It took the national and international news agencies longer to get to Asheville, North Carolina, than it did for them to learn how Grand Meister Simon Bishop had organized the largest single act of civil disobedience in the history of the world. Nobody in Castalia had any intention of hiding their involvement. Sixers and Meisters from across the planet had gathered on the maidan to watch the Strike unfold on giant displays. Simon had stayed up all night to catch the latest news from Asia and Europe. After the triumphal Los Angeles mission, which turned the entire city into a parking lot for fifteen minutes, he accepted the congratulations of Grand Meister Desi, who placed a laurel wreath on his head up on the central dais in the Castalia castle.

“NNC says this is the largest single day global demonstration in history. You stopped traffic all over L.A. Next time you should try to get traffic moving in LA,” Desi joked. “Except for the naked sunbathing on the Santa Monica Freeway and the thousand-person conga line on Cahuenga Pass, I’m not sure anyone noticed.”

“Next time we strike, we won’t stop,” Simon yelled and the Meisters cheered and danced. It was obvious to him that the Meisters had been waiting for a real leader to step up. Desi was just too old to figure that out. Simon turned and strode away, pounding the pavers with his staff, out the open portcullis to where the Sixers were assembled.

Desi watched Simon go. An enormous shout rose from the crowds outside the castle walls. He logged out and called Jennifer, but she was not in her cabin. Little Simon was going to be a handful, he sighed to himself.

Desi’s cabin at the Ranch was perfect. The staff could not do enough for the Grand Meister. Still, he was a lonesome cowboy. He poured a flute of Cristal and settled back in his robe.

“Busy, busy, busy,” he said and scratched at the residue of glitter on the inside of his knee.

By Monday noon Haverbrook’s parking lot was overflowing with news vans and satellite uplinks. Rector Hector had instructions to prevent any interviews with Simon. With reporters leaking out all over the campus, interviewing janitors, classmates, and teachers, it was only a matter of time before they located Simon in the Rectory, where he was locked in Hector’s office. Reverend Bishop’s jet would be arriving by mid afternoon.

Word that Simon had been “rescued” from his prison and would be holding a press conference in the auditorium reached Hector as he was talking to the local deputy sheriff about traffic control.

“Good lord!” he cried and fled toward the main building. His path was obstructed by hundreds of reporters with camera crews. “Let me pass!” he called to their backs.

Simon stepped up on the stage in his cloak. He leaned theatrically on his staff, which had finally been delivered to the school.

“I bring you all greetings from the Meisters of Castalia,” he said while a hundred cameras flashed away. “As the press reports from Asia are now confirming, the Game is back. It will be live everywhere today at midnight local time. By this time next year we hope to have more than two billion Gamers across the planet. I want to welcome you all to our brave, new world!”

Scratchy logged into the Room and stepped over to the console where he opened up the IDE. The code files for Junana and the Game were all there and he could read them. He opened up an edit window for a random file and got a message screen:

Unauthorized. ROOT-level authority required.

“Locked out of my own code,” he whispered to himself.

“Michael?”

Scratchy looked up from his laptop. “What’s up?”

“The taxi’s here to take us to the airport and you haven’t even begun to pack,” Betsy said.

“Tell Timmy to come up for a cup of coffee while I pack. Looks like I’m going to have a lot of time on my hands.”

“Why’s that?”

He told her about the IDE.

“Can the Game actually write its own code?”

“Within limits, I imagine. Any major upgrading should require expert human coding. I guess at some point even that will end. Looks like I’m out of work.”

“Then why are you smiling?”

“I’m the guy who likes to laugh last, remember?”

Just after midnight, New Orleans time, Jennifer logged into the Game from her room in Betsy’s guest cottage to begin a new Query. She hoped to unwind Governmentality back to its seed. She intended to spend an hour or so, but after five hours of questions and pathways through petabytes of information, her computer stalled again. A message appeared, “Cannot Predict Now.”

“Zut alors!” Not again. She was about to reboot when suddenly her avatar was holding a wooden staff. Almost immediately a Guide walked into the screen from the right, as if entering from another room. It was Michelle.

“Grand Meister Jennifer,” Michelle bowed deeply. “Let me be the first to congratulate you! Notices have been sent to the other two Grand Meisters. I would like to suggest we meet in Castalia after you have a rest. There is so much that needs doing.”

Don Driscoll had to be desperate to even think about what he was contemplating. After all, this was how he’d actually ended up in Santiago. They had chased him out of towns and villages all the way south from Arizona. The money he earned from his last under-the-table Java programming job was gone and the cupboard was bare. He still had seven thousand in that bank account in Chino and a ready-teller card burning through his wallet.

Don waited in the shadow of a street promenade until nobody was in sight and slipped across the street. He inserted his ATM card and keyed in his PIN code and the cash request.

“Come on, come on!” he yelled at the machine. It whirled away, counting out the bills. His card emerged. He was waiting for his cash when a small man in an old suit opened up the door to the bank from the inside.

“I’m just leaving!” Don yelled, getting ready to run. The man was smiling.

“Wait!” he said in Spanish. “I have a message for you.”

Don snatched the bills from the ATM and turned to face him. “Yeah?”

“Somebody named Scratchy O’hara says you are pardoned. Do you understand? He says for you to have a nice life and come back to Junana any time.”

“You’re not going to hit me?”

“My Guide says I should make you feel safe. Mr. Driscoll, do you feel safe? Do you need anything?”

Don was crying all of the sudden. It was the first time in a long time someone had called him by his real name without cursing at him. He shook his head and stepped out of the shadow onto the bright street.

“Have a nice life, Mr. Driscoll!” the man nodded and retreated back into the bank.

“It’s all gone!” Bishop whined. “That was not the deal. We need our cash back. You promised...”

“Read your investment contract,” Harold sighed. Bishop’s church was just a small minority investor. Several organizations lost significantly more, and they were not really big on brotherly love. Harold had resigned from his post at the RIND Institute before they could sack him.

“The losses will put us out of business. They’ll take everything!”

“You’ve still got the power of prayer,” Harold taunted him. “Maybe your son will tell us how the hell they knocked us out so completely that my hackers are fucking mystified.” It was like the Game was defending itself against attack.

“Leave my son out of this!” Bishop yelled. He had flown Simon and Peter home. Simon had been called into the local FBI office for a whole day. Gerry had uninstalled the broadband connection to his house, where Simon was under constant watch. Simon told him he confessed his role to the authorities and encouraged them all to play that blasted Game of his. Arlene Stone wouldn’t return his phone calls. The deacons called an emergency board meeting for next tuesday. And now Freddy Earl wanted Simon on his show!

The previous night the Nerds and the Posse had been surprised to learn that they would ride the Hidden Desire Krewe float up St. Charles Street, preceded by the Krewe’s crack team of 24 mostly naked fire-spinners, led, as usual, by Betsy. The Krewe float had a Game door in the front and a fantasy garden of flowers and mythical animals, unicorns and griffins. They threw coins and beads down to the crowds. Alice flashed her breasts a few times but failed to get Jennifer and Claire in the mood.

In the morning, Itchy’s Castalia crew made sure Castalia was ready to celebrate their new Grand Meister. Flowers and ribbons overflowed the walls. Trumpeters and heralds sounded her arrival. Jack, Alice, and Itchy were Sixers and would be logging in from their B&B rooms down the street from Betsy’s house. Claire and Winston were picking up Megan and Nick at the New Orleans Airport that afternoon.

Jennifer talked Scratchy into logging into Castalia. He insisted that his newly scanned avatar wear street clothes and that Betsy be given the same courtesy.

“Bien sur!” she replied. “You are both entirely welcome to Castalia any time, and you can come naked if you want.”

The couple’s avatars showed up at the gate to Castalia barefoot in matching tie-dyed hemp t-shirts and shorts. Desi escorted them to the center of the Castle. Several Meisters were old-timer hackers who had met Scratchy at one or more BarCamps, so there was much merriment over his presence. This day Castalia was also mobbed by Gamers joyful in the return of the Game. Up on the dais, Desi had prepared a brief welcome and a surprise.

Jennifer logged into Castalia to the sound of trumpets. She made her way through the throngs of applauding Meisters and Sixers to the dais, where Desi stood tall and greeted her with a hug and a kiss on both cheeks.

“Let me be the first to introduce to you Grand Meister Jennifer Bouchez,” he called to the crowds. They yelled their welcome. Jennifer stood and bowed low to them.

“I am honored by this welcome,” she said. “I hope to be of service to the Meisters of Castalia.” She nodded to Desi, who continued.

“I am sorry that Grand Meister Simon cannot be with us. His father, it seems, has...” Desi glanced around at Scratchy and raised one eyebrow “...grounded him.” A knowing groan rippled through the young crowd. “As soon as Simon can find an Internet connection he will certainly wish to add his welcome to our new Grand Meister. Today is Mardi Gras in New Orleans, and we have much to do, so I will keep this short.”

“Please gather around and pay attention.” He banged the base of his staff on the dais and this sound was amplified throughout Castalia. Out on the maidan a thousand conversations stopped mid-sentence. Everyone looked up at the monitors framing a shot of Desi.

“Before I continue, I want to acknowledge the visit of someone very special to Castalia. Let us all give a Gamer welcome to Mr. Michael “Scratchy” O’hara, who unfolded the templates that run this whole program! Come on up!” He gestured for Scratchy to climb up on the dais. The call of “Scratchy, Scratchy, Scratchy!” grew to a cacophony. Reluctantly, Michael climbed the stairs and stood next to Desi. The crowd roared. Scratchy waved, smiled sheepishly, and then walked back down the stairs where his avatar’s face was covered in kisses from Alice and Betsy.

“These months without the Game have been a time of great suffering and also a learning moment for the Gamer community. Now that the Game is back...”

The crowd lifted off its feet in a great roar. The numbers of Meisters and Sixers had been increasing steadily over the past half hour, and Castalia was now filled to its walls. Desi looked around him in amazement.

“Now that the Game is back,” he said again. “We have to give thanks to those who made this possible. I want to first thank all of the programmers in Sao Do for their tireless efforts over these months.” He bowed deeply to the Sao Do avatar continigent as applause rippled through the crowd.

“I want to also thank the Castalia hacker and griefer communities. You know who you are.”

Another yell went up. Desi waited for the crowd to settle.

“Finally we must all thank the entity who brought the Game back to us. She comes to Castalia at our invitation and represents the Guild of Guides. I present to you all Guild Master Michelle Valentine Smith.”

A bright column of light suddenly appeared on the dais between Desi and Jennifer. Within this, shimmering for a tantalizing minute and then solidifying as the light dimmed stood Michelle, barefoot and splendid in her own beauty. It was a classic Star Trek transporter entrance. The crowd gasped. Scratchy nodded his approval.

“Jimbo, you rock,” he said.

Michelle bowed to the Grand Meisters who returned the courtesy.

 “This is the day the Game has been waiting for,” she began. “The day it made possible. The day...” she paused and continued slowly, her voice gaining volume with each word. “The day the Game begins its rule!”

She thrust her hand up in an Angela Davis power salute that sent the crowd into a delirium. For several minutes the assembled thousands of avatars jumped and danced.

Betsy turned to Michael, sitting next to him on the sofa in her living room, both of them logged into Castalia on their laptops. “Rule what?”

“That’s the question. The game has no economy, no government, no army, no police.”

“Not yet.”

Michelle raised her hands and the crowd grew silent.

“The Guild of Guides stands at your side as you prepare for your role in leading this new Game Nation.” She closed her eyes and stepped back. Her form faded into nothing.

After Michelle vanished from the dais, Jennifer and Desi spent an extra hour walking around Castalia, talking with as many Meisters and Sixers as they could. Everyone wanted to know about Michelle. Rumors of the fantastical powers of the Guild of Guilds were flowing, and, in truth, Desi could not deny them. They finally logged off and prepared for the evening’s recreation over at The Leg Bar. First they would all gather at Betsy’s house for barbecue.
