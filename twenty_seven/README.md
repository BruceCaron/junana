# Twenty Seven
As the Year of the Five Skillings drew to its end, the Nerds and the Posse gathered most nights in Desi’s apartment on the top floor of the building that housed Ricardos. Salsa soaked through the floor while they finished off their ca phe sua nong and pastries and talked through the evening. Desi had hijacked an actual Cuban jazz ensemble touring Vietnam on a cultural exchange; they now played five nights a week for a salary several times what they made in Havana. Tonight, Betsy announced she had isolated the source of what Scratchy was calling the aphrodisiac quality of the Game.

“The Game teaches men something about which society’s been deskilling them for centuries,” she said.

“Probably for millennia!” Alice added and glanced over at Itchy, who frowned at her comically. Alice made a face back at him.

“You two stop making google eyes at each other,” Betsy said, “That creeps me out worse than the stupid hand motions.” Alice and Itchy, who would have thought! He’s so skinny, Alice will break him in half. Mikey thought they looked cute together. He called them “Laurel and Hearty.” Itchy is a gentle geek and Alice maybe could use some gentling. She looked over at Jenn, who was still spending way too much time in the Game trying to lick Level Seven. Desi was the only one in the world to have done that.

“No worse than Claire playing footsie with Winston under the table,” Scratchy said. “You all have hotel rooms, you know.” Winston and Claire and Itchy and Alice already spent more time commuting between hotel rooms than they did out at Sao Do. Desi was always in Castalia. He tried to meet every new Meister. That left Scratchy and Betsy to work on keeping the Game intact and trying to gauge its many impacts. Lately, the hacks had been getting through some of their defenses. Scratchy shut down the old Internet interface to Junana entirely when they hacked through this last week. It wouldn’t be long before the dedicated client failed.

Winston pantomimed his innocence while Claire pounded on Scratchy’s shoulder with her fist.

“If you don’t like us getting friendly, don’t look,” she repeated until Scratchy shrugged and smiled at her. She leaned over and kissed him on the cheek. Claire was amazing, he knew. All the Posse looked up to her. Winston, he seemed just as happy today as he did when he was running naked across the Eastmoreland fairways thirty years ago.

“Just don’t nibble on his niblick,” Scratchy said, “at least not while you’re at the table.”

“Or pat his putter,” Desi added.

“Or stroke his driver...,” Itchy said.

“You all done?” Winston asked the room.

“Not on your life!” Betsy said, “...or fondle his balls.” The table broke up with laughter.

“Or tickle his tees,” Jenn added.

“For God’s sake, don’t ever kiss his bag,” Alice said.

Winston looked over to Claire. “You’re it!”

“I plan to do all of that later tonight...” she reported, as the room roared its approval, “...for as long as he can still get it up and in.” Scratchy almost fell out of his chair laughing.

“Go on, Liz,” Desi said finally as the conversation reassembled itself. “You were saying?”

“After Gamers unfold the template for the Social, even those with dicks learn how to...” She waited while they all looked at her.

“...listen.”

“That’s amazing!” Jenn said. “I’d always assumed that the dick evolved specifically to disable this capacity.”

“I’m sorry, did you say something?” Desi quipped.

“That was the accepted science on the subject until today,” Claire said.

“Clinically confirmed,” Alice added. “With millions of available test cases.”

“Funny,” Scratchy said, “My research points to another conclusion.”

“Speak, Geek King,” Winston said, “So that we might salvage something of our dignity...”

“Or at least our dick-nity,” Itchy said.

“After Gamers unfold the template for the Internal Voice, even those with tits...”

Scratchy leaned back in his chair and took a long sip from his cup of Desi’s metal-pressed highland coffee and condensed milk.

“... stop endlessly chattering on and on, so everyone’s ears get a break!”

“It’s a healing moment,” Itchy said, touching his ears. “First the ringing stops, and then you begin to pick up noises you’ve never been able to hear before...”

“...and a few you can expect to hear later tonight,” Alice shot back at him.

“The fact is, the Social templates open up avenues for conversational and emotional intimacy that many cultures have not explored and that teenagers almost never imagined,” Betsy concluded.

“Just so they’re not killing themselves anymore,” Winston said.

Four cellphones started ringing, all in the same ominous ringtone. The Nerds glanced at one another as they answered. The Posse shared a moment of panic watching the Nerds expressions fall as they listened.

“Can you reboot?” Scratchy asked finally. “Do you have any access code that works?” He listened. “All right, Get some sleep. We start our counter attack in the morning.”

They all hung up.

“We’re hacked,” Winston said.

“Game’s offline,” Desi added.

“Well, it’s almost three years since we went public. Just like Jack called it,” said Scratchy.

“Someone else is running Junana,” Itchy added. “They’re calling it “Unana’.”

“We’re locked out,” Scratchy concluded. “The pirates have our ship now.”

“Speaking of ships,” Desi said. “Jack’s yacht will be here tomorrow. He’s flying in to join it.”

“What about Castalia?” Jenn asked.

“That’s right!” Desi said. “Castalia has its own log in.”

He went over to his laptop. “It’s up,” he announced. “Oh, my God, you should see what they’ve done to Junana!”

Reverend Bishop went on TV the very next morning to announce that the Church was a key player in the destruction of the Game.

He crowed, “we’ve torn this vital technology out the hands of anarchists and atheists and put it to God’s purpose.” Freddy Earl gave him half an hour to show off his new virtual cathedrals.

The more credit Bishop took the worse things went for Simon and Peter. Their classmates at Haverbrook took every opportunity to shun them. Haverbrook students, being from a UCCC school, also found their former Asheville friends to be suddenly hostile. Simon took his father’s role in the Game’s destruction as a personal badge of shame. While his classmates made it clear they thought he should feel rotten, quite on his own he felt even worse than that.

Peter applied the Five Skillings to deflect the blame. None of this was his fault, after all. “I’m not my father,” he told them all. “And as soon as I’m 16, I’m gone.” Tiffanie seemed unfazed at the Game’s fate and allowed him to get to third base.

Simon kept replaying the final minutes of his last Query in his mind. Had he just imagined the wooden staff? At that moment he was almost brain dead from his efforts, so he might have hallucinated the thing. Not that it mattered, with the Game gone, being a Grand Meister was about as useful as winning Tetris. He was far too ashamed anyhow to show up in Castalia, where he imagined his fellow Meisters had already erected a gallows for his avatar.

The school year ended in a cascade of acrimony. With the KayAye out of order, teachers attempted to lead discussions based on their own remembered Queries. The taste of the Game lingered bitter and sweet upon all these interactions. A great sadness, a sense of profound loss, a vacant hopelessness enveloped the school. Rector Hector, portly and distracted, rolled out for commencement. The ceremony was brief and without joy. The students fled back to their homes, mindful that the summer would not include any Game time.

The Nerds used Castalia to pass along news about the status of Junana and the Game. Itchy’s crew installed digital kiosks where they detailed their efforts to regain control of the software. They encouraged Sixers to work within their schools and GameTowns to practice the Five Skillings until the Game could be rebooted. Desi was adamant about giving players hope. Scratchy offered little of this.

“It’s someone else’s picnic now,” he noted. “And we’re not even in the park.”

Whoever took over Junana was also blocking their email servers, so Desi was unable to directly contact Gamers. A group of Castalians asked if they might produce a newsletter to be distributed physically from Red Star Coffee houses and digitally across the blogosphere. The Daily Castalian was born. Various communities of practice coalesced within the Castalia population. They appropriated the new kiosks to schedule meetings on the grounds. One of these, the Griefer Guild, gathered hackers across the planet together to attack the Unana interface.

“Now they want to vote,” Desi said. “The Meisters want to take positions that have the authority of democratic choice.”

“We can do that,” Itchy said. “My crew can mash up a voting application for Castalia in the next Scrum sprint.”

The Meisters of Castalia as a community voted to boycott the Unana interface. Within weeks the grounds of Castalia were filled with hundreds of small group discussions anchored by various interests and projects. Sixers argued that they deserved a vote too.

“Right now voting is simply a tool for expressing opinions,” said Jennifer. “But at some point we might need to consider actual governance for Castalia.”

“I think only Grand Meisters should vote,” Scratchy said.

“They’re an unruly bunch, these young Meisters,” Desi observed. “They won’t much like the idea of a dictatorship.”

Arlene Stone was thrilled by the new Unana.com. Tom Verplanck gave her a personal backstage tour of the top floor of a Unana Mall: a pure vision of fashion heaven. It made Rodeo Drive look like K Mart. Tom had pre-dressed Arlene’s avatar in a Chanel black dress and said she looked just like Jackie O.

“They’ve put up little campaign stickers all over the place in the Malls,” said Arlene. “You know the ones I mean? They say ‘W. G. Stone’ in a silver star. Just like a real grassroots effort. Like thousands of supporters just couldn’t help themselves and had to let the world know they love the job you’re doing. Tom says its viral advertising. I’m not sure what that means.”

Stone was preparing for his reelection bid in the next year. The opposition was scattered and underfunded. The campaign trail still would need his full attention. You can’t count your chickens before they’re hatched.

“It means we’ll be paying for this service for years, just like it was a bad disease,” W. G. groused. Normal advertising rules didn’t apply to social networks. His campaign had bought an exclusive right for political ads in Unana. “Tom better be right about this.” Karl had told W. G. to avoid anything to do with Unana. History had shown W. G. that there’s no good future in betting against Karl.

The summer and fall passed without the Game. Scratchy’s hacker brigade and the Griefer Guild worked day and night with little to show for their efforts. The anger of the Castalians gave way to frustration. The GameTowns no longer boiled with fury. A riptide of hopelessness emerged that took all of the skillings of the Game to navigate. Gamers missed their Queries like junkies going cold turkey. There was still music and books and conversations in the baths and the new luxury of time.

Across the planet a billion gamers looked up from their computers and saw their world anew. Gamers wandered back out on the streets. They watched the cable news stations and read the daily papers. They applied their newly acquired, template-fuelled intuitions to the fact of ongoing brutal wars, economic inequality, rampant symbolic violence, galloping climate change, and the capitulation of governments large and small to the whims and the worms of global capitalism. They re-encountered the prepackaged cultural content that was, only weeks before, their life’s central passion. The grease-larded fast food, overproduced sporting spectacles, vacuously violent films, and fantastically priced fashions and consumer toys, muscle cars, and designer accessories appeared oddly ethnographic: objects from some other place or time.

Many were amazed at how bad things had become in only a few months, not at first recognizing that nothing else had changed but them. Gamers fell back upon the Internet to answer questions they could no longer Query. Millions of them opened up new blogs. The search engines hummed, and new social networks sprouted to take up the slack. It was as though a billion people had individually inherited a fortune tainted by mismanagement and excess and a burning need to sort out this mess as soon as possible.

As Jack Dobron had noticed in the years before that first fateful Kyoto meeting, the nearly incomprehensible incompetence of the state in the face of the marketplace endangered every human on the planet. Perhaps the only expected outcome from the Game is that several hundred million people now shared that fact. The other five billion inhabitants of the planet might have stayed blissfully preoccupied with the same meaningless bullshit that the Now continued to dish at them, but for this new undercurrent of discontent.

Gamers were, after all, nothing if not articulate. They had spent a few thousand hours arguing with a Guide that could think and respond faster than any human. A rising tsunami of recrimination flooded the blogs, the mags, and the airwaves. And yet, while the five skillings pushed each Gamer toward personal virtuosity, nothing moved Gamers as a community beyond their savage critiques of the status quo. Without the Game they were adrift.
