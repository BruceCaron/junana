Donald Driscoll had held many jobs far worse than the one he now held as CIO of WeRus in Goleta, California. The pay and the benefits were spectacular, and the equipment and support were top-of-the-line. He operated a two-thousand-node XServe server farm that ran Scratchy’s software like it was Tetris.

On a day-to-day basis, Don really had no complaints. When he needed new software or another assistant, a simple email to Michael O’hara was all it took. Goleta was a lot closer to the Pacific than Chico. So he figured the reason he was becoming increasingly aggravated had nothing to do with the work, but rather with the growing suspicion that someone else was in line to make bank on this software, and nobody, and certainly not Michael “Scratchy” O’hara, had invited Don to the party.

Don had been at the infohelm of a once-promising dot-com company when its stock valuations would have put his net worth into eight digits. WeBWillacker had a tiny fraction of the customer base and use volume that Junana.com had. Of course, WeBWillacker never got to its IPO, which is why Don ended up in Chico. Even if WeRus was just a subcontractor, Don was sure that Scratchy had a piece of the pie, only the bastard wasn’t sharing.

As she sat at her desk in the still quiet classroom where classes would begin Monday, Amanda flipped through her copy of Gatsby, organizing her thoughts. She would start them out with some questions about the main characters and then on to the main motifs. She tried to imagine a class where more than one of the students had read the text. There was always one who did, even with Moby Dick. The problem was always the other thirty-four of them. Still, the wave of trepidation that normally announced the beginning of the school year was, this day, still foamed with optimistic anticipation.

Amanda thumbed to the back of the book, to her favorite quote: “They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.” Amanda always felt the tug of envy when she read this. She knew she should, instead, despise the careless rich, but she would rather join them, if only she could. Let someone else, anyone else, teach their ungrateful children. One more year—she could hold out if only five of them read the book. That was her promise to herself.

Scratchy was adamant that the Game should not merely exist outside the educational system as some technological alternative.

“We are not the educational equivalent of Homeopathy,” he declared. “We need to intersect, intervene, hell, invade educational systems. The point is to replace these, not merely annoy them.”

“You are getting mighty high minded,” Jack said, “for someone who only wanted to give the planet a hot foot.”

“That’s before we figured out how to take a student from high school to a graduate degree in two years,” Scratchy said. “Why should they have to compete in that educational survival show when they’ve already won the race?”

“A third of the world’s population is under twenty years of age, and a hundred million are ready for college but can’t go because there aren’t enough colleges to admit them,” Jack said.

“Imagine being in high school when you are sixteen, and then knowing enough to teach at a university by your eighteenth birthday,” Desi said. “But they could still go to college, for the fun of it, I mean.”

“The best years of my life,” Winston said. “Are we going to deprive a whole generation of that chance?”

“We all need that simultaneous vacation from childhood and adulthood,” Itchy said. “The license to do anything that comes to mind, and the friends who dare you to try.”

“We thought we knew everything there was to know the week we arrived at Reed,” Scratchy said. “Only these kids will actually know it all, or they’ll have their finger on the means to learn anything they don’t already know.”

“Let’s say 200 million players get Yanagi University degrees, and what does this give them?” Winson asked.

“You could ask the same thing about an A.B. from Harvard,” Jack said.

“Or Reed,” Scratchy added. “At least Yanagi U. is voluntary and free. The point of education is to open up more doorways, add new paths, broaden perspectives. Everything else is just vocational training.”

“How do we get the Game to play with their local schools without the schools’ support?” Desi asked.

“That’s actually very easy,” Winston said. “Schools and colleges are increasingly interconnected by very hackable databases. And they are linked into large commercial learning management systems or to commercial anti-plagiarism services. Either way we can access their class lists. We might want to purchase the two or three largest anti-plagiarism services; they won’t cost much and we can improve on them with our code. What do you think, Jack?”

“Buyout saves us time over starting our own services,” Jack said. “Maybe Scratchy can see about getting us into student records at the learning management system firms.”

“Governments spend hundreds of billions of dollars doing education...” Itchy said.

“...and doing it so very poorly, too,” Desi added.

“Money down the well,” Jack agreed. “We’ll do it cheaper, better, and faster. I share Winston’s concern that we don’t lose the social benefits of going to college. I want to make Yanagi University a real place, not just an on online service.”

“So the college kids will continue to live off their parents, stay in their college dorms, take massive quantities of drugs, listen to shitty techno until dawn, get drunk and fuck like sea otters. In reality, what they are doing is finishing off their masters at good ol’ Yanagi U.” Scratchy chuckled. The convict face on his avatar looked like it was gargling gravel.

“Instead of playing Halo 5 or WoW every night,” Desi reminded them.

“You mean they’ll graduate from Penn or UCLA or wherever and actually know something?” Winston said.

“Their parents should be paying us,” Jack said.

“This doesn’t violate our ‘no personal beliefs’ oath, does it?” Desi asked.

“As long as we’re not telling them what to learn. They’re still the ones asking all the questions,” Scratchy said.

“Of course the colleges are never going to inform the parents that their kids should be teaching classes instead of taking classes,” Winston said.

“What happens when the parents start playing the Game? Are they still going to cough up 50 thousand a year so Junior can get that Ivy League merit badge?” Scratchy said.

“I’m pretty sure our little Game will not be the one that pushes universities to change. It will be shut down long before that. But the next game, or the next,” Jack said.

“Once Scratchy’s code goes open source, people can make their own games,” Desi said.

“I hear you’re already on Level Five,” Winston said.

“Well, I’ve got the best Guide,” Desi said.

“You programmed him to say that to you,” Scratchy noted.

“Doesn’t mean it’s not true,” Desi laughed. “You ought to try it.”

“Not me. I wouldn’t play any Game programmed by a bunch of maniacs like you.”

“Like us,” Desi corrected him.

“Exactly.”

Game Release + Eleven Months

Claire Doolan got home late again, well after eight. She dropped her briefcase in the hall and went straight up to Megan’s room where Megan, as usual, was at her computer. She also had her microphone headset on and was speaking into it. Claire slipped in behind her daughter and watched over her shoulder. Megan caught her reflection in the screen and gave her a glance and a nod. Claire tried to follow what her daughter was doing.

Megan was simultaneously watching a video, talking to some game token, and typing in questions, or were they commands? As she typed, the video changed. Video and still images flickered by along with pages of text that were displayed for an instant. Hardly enough time for Claire to read the top sentence.

Megan typed furiously as she spoke. “If our habitus is pulling us back to our childhood, how do we create a new moment of reflexive analysis?”

“What did you just say?” Claire asked.

“Shit!” Megan whispered. Suddenly the video ended. The game token, a good looking boy on a horse, said something.

“I know, I got distracted. My mom’s in the room. What?” Megan said. She turned to Claire.

“Bobby said someone named Annika wants to talk to you really soon.”

“Tell Bobby I’m angry that you haven’t eaten the quiche I left in the refrigerator for your supper.”

Megan put her hand over the microphone. “Don’t say that, he might hear you.”

“What’s happened to your room?” Claire looked around her. Books, papers, empty soda bottles, and clothing were all jumbled about. Megan had always been super neat. Claire never had to pick up her room for her, even when Megan was little girl. Now it looked like adolescence had caught up to her.

“I’ve been busy. Anyhow, it’s summer, at least for another week, and I need to relax. And...” She lifted her left arm and sniffed. “... I really need a shower.” She stood and walked past Claire toward her bathroom.

“Didn’t you take one this morning?” Claire called after her.

“Talk later,” Megan shut the bathroom door.

Claire stared at the closed door and reflected back to the time Megan was a first-grader. She would jump out of the car on the curb with that arms-open, face forward, eyes wide, running, waving goodbye without turning around, cannot wait to start the school day, and Claire would watch her all the way to the building. Wasn’t that almost every day? There was the day that Brad pushed her into the puddle, and the other time when Sally said things that made her cry. On the whole, grade school was a wonderland of new experiences.

What happened in the following years is not hard to explain. Megan’s life had escaped the classroom and the curriculum, and became centered on her digital social network. Megan lived in a complex digital jungle. By contrast, school was a daily digital desert: no cell phones, no instant messaging, no Internet, no music sharing, no mashups, just textbooks and tests. By her tweens, Megan was bored out of her skull, and so she turned to fashion and pop cultural fantasy. Claire’s daughter became another data point on the Con|Int consumer graph, begging for the latest Evisu jeans.

Claire knew it was impossible for Santa Monica High School to open up to the cell phone, instant messaging, Junana-driven world that existed outside its campus. If they ever allowed phones and PDAs and computers in the classroom, most of the students would be back in their social jungles in five minutes flat. And yet, that jungle was their home, and when school shut it down at eight-thirty in the morning something in them died. The students who sat there and gazed out the window, the books in their hands, clutched like artifacts from some ancient foreign place, had shut down that small pilot light of curiosity required to ignite the flame of learning.

It is nobody’s fault any more than everyone’s. The teachers were mere tourists at the digital life world, while the kids were natives. In the 1990s teachers went out of pocket to get educational software that failed them horribly. The Internet promised unlimited free access to information and delivered porn and spam to their classrooms. The kids were smarter than the filters. So it was back to books at the same time “No Child Left Awake” pushed classrooms from teaching to testing.

Claire was happy that she never, ever considered teaching high school. At the same time she sorely wished she could offer Megan something different and better. Even Claire’s high school days, as darkly difficult as she remembered them, resemble halcyon days of yearning and learning compared with Megan’s life. Megan refused Claire’s offer of summer camp in the Sierras and the media camp over at UCLA. Now she spent her days on some computer game and forgot to shower. Could it get any worse? Claire snagged all the empty soda bottles she could find and went down to the kitchen to start dinner.

The Room was now a grass hut with a thatched roof. Smaller than usual, the Cordobaloungers crowded near its back wall.

“Why can’t we just tell it what kind of room we want?” Scratchy said.

“Itchy programmed it to be self-learning. It starts with one of twenty substances and uses the room Template structure to design the entire outcome,” Winston said. “Look at the weave on the thatch. Amazing.”

Itchy and Jack materialized at almost the same time. Jack took up a Cordobalounger between Scratchy and Winston. Itchy stood his avatar facing them.

“I have excellent news to announce,” Jack confessed.

“You open a Cuban restaurant somewhere?” Scratchy asked.

“Something like that. Ichiro, did you notice the construction across the street from your office in Kyoto?”

“The dormitory for Doshisha University?”

“It’s next to Doshisha, but run by an independent company. Like 93 others around the world.”

“Mr. Slick’s been busy!” Desi walked his avatar over and put its arm around Jack’s shoulders. “We play with pixels. He plays with concrete.”

“Not really dormitories,” Jack added. “More like a city within a city. I call them ‘GameTowns’.” He described these new structures.

The building used the “folded street” template to articulate the relationship between the individual apartments and their neighbors along a mobius-like ramp. In elevation, the buildings looked curiously like a stack of giant bow ties. In plan, the twin loops opened up light wells carrying sunlight down to the translucent domes over two giant public bath structures.

The buildings could be constructed to hold from 178 to 394 rooms before the folded street became too long for the student in the top room to be able to reach to reach the front entrance within the ten minutes that the “exit anxiety” template required.

The ground-level- and a sub-ground-level plan called for a complex of utility rooms for shared uses: dining, computer labs, theaters, exercise rooms, and laundry facilities. The large bath structures were detailed in the plans as “swimming pools with spas.” Once permitted, they would be modified to become public baths.

Building such a structure completely on site would have been enormously complex and impractical. Building just one of them would have been a certain financial shipwreck. Jack was way ahead of this situation. His real-estate holding companies had been negotiating with universities and colleges in 47 cities in the U.S. and more than 50 other cities worldwide to construct these dormitories on sites near their campuses. He had already designed and built the regional factories to pre-assemble the building parts and furnishings.

“The entire structure looks like something melded from the work of Seven Holl and Moshe Saftie,” Jack added.

“Why dormitories?” Winston asked. “Why not just apartment houses?”

“Zoning,” replied Jack. “Particularly parking. If you build an apartment building, you need to build a huge parking garage almost the size of the apartment building. I’m building for Game players who might not want to own a car. Besides, universities are always looking for better housing for their students and are always happy not to pay for this. I’ve had college presidents begging their cities not to obstruct our construction plans. That’s why I built our GameTowns next to actual colleges.” He paused, glancing his avatar around the Room.

“I don’t get it,” Desi said.

“It’s the same reason he builds his Red Star Coffee houses next door to Starbucks,” Winston said. “It’s called the ‘bazaar effect.’ You get the overflow from neighboring shops.”

“I’m sure there’s a template in there somewhere.” Scratchy said. “Fuckin’ always is.”

“College students who take up the Game are going to be spending a lot less time in the classroom. They might as well hang at the nearby GameTown,” Itchy said.

“But you’re not building for the local college students,” Scratchy said. “Who’s going to live there?”

“I’ve incorporated Yanagi University in New York State, with official branches in England, Germany, Switzerland, Japan, China, Brazil, and South Africa,” Jack announced. “Other countries will have to rely on distance learning degrees.”

“The name was my idea, or rather Winston’s,” Itchy said and turned to face Winston, who found the command to shrug.

“That first day in Kyoto, I told you we were meeting Mr. Slick at Yanagi Yuu, and you asked if it was a university.”

“So we’re running a university now?” Desi asked.

“Some day it will be the largest on the planet,” Jack said. “I’ve gifted all the Gametowns over to this new institution.”

“Jack’s ‘all in’, too.” Desi smiled.

“Robby figures users will be Ph.D. worthy after Level Four,” Itchy said.

“Might as well give them a diploma with their wardrobe,” Scratchy said. “Only I’d suggest we give them a master’s, not a Ph.D. Doing a doctorate means that you’ve added new knowledge into the corpus. The Game simply reassembles existing knowledge.”

“They can take their Yanagi University master’s and finish up a doctorate somewhere else,” Winston said. “Makes perfect sense.”

“Only a small percentage of the Game players will be able to live in the GameTowns. I’m reserving space for upper level players only. I’m also experimenting with a retail space concept based on a template called ‘retail gradient’,” he added.

Once built, the dining facilities in the GameTowns would be remodeled into a mix of restaurants, cafes, and coffee shops. These eating spots would be complemented by kiosks on the edges of the structure for snacks and other consumables.

“What’s the return on investment look like?” Winston asked.

“Since I want these to be models for others to follow,” Jack said. “I’m creating the construction system so that the development costs can be recouped in seven years. We will have housing for 50,000 students within 48 months. We can feed several times that number,” Jack said. “I’m going to release the technology and the architectural plans through a Creative Commons license.”

“Jack, you old commie, you’ve joined the pubic domain.” Desi clapped him on his back.

“I guess we’d better actually build the fucking Game, so you’ll have some tenants.” Scratchy smiled his convict grin.

“I’d like that.”

“You don’t show it.”

“Wait.” Jack’s avatar sat still while he searched the menu for facial expressions. Finally a smile spread across it. “How’s that?”

“RTFM.” Scratchy said. “Good thing nobody’s shooting at you. Keep grinning, dude, because we just went beta with the Game in Sao Do.”

The avatars went through an elaborate ‘high-five’ routine. Then Desi unzipped his pants and pulled out...

“Whoa there!” Scratchy said.

...a magnum of Cristal champagne. He shook this until the cork exploded into the thatch. Then he sprayed them all down, giggling.

“We done here?” Itchy asked.

“Looks like it,” Winston said. “Till next time.”

One by one they disappeared.

Game Release + One Year

“You will need to remove your hats.” Amanda Baxter reminded her students. “This is a high school, not a coffee house.”

This year even some of the girls were wearing hats. The most popular seemed to be a black cotton hat with a red star on its front. They had discussed this hat in the faculty meeting. Someone had guessed it was a gang symbol, and then Phil Quigley, the ninth-grade general-science teacher pulled one out of his pack and said it was from a computer game. No need to ban the hat from campus, but still, Amanda would not allow students to wear them in her classroom.

She had only 26 students enrolled. Enrollment had quite suddenly become an issue. Over the summer several dozen students had tested out of Santa Barbara High. The senior class was hardest hit with some courses cancelled because of the lack of students. Teaching only 26 students would be a great luxury for Amanda, but the faculty lounge was abuzz with talk of layoffs.

Amanda took roll, handed out the syllabus, and described her homework philosophy and the anti-plagiarism software they used. She chastened the students who arrived late and finished up with her speech about how literature opened up windows to worlds of wonder. They would have such a grand year together.

As she spoke she sized up the students with a practiced eye. Some were attentive, others distracted, and still others already showing signs of unease or boredom. The girls were dressed more sensibly this year. Only a few wore paint-tight spaghetti-strap tops and microskirts. Apart from looking uncomfortably dressed, they could barely breathe or move without exposing their thongs. A small minority, they looked uncomfortably out of place. Good for that. The boys were still in their jeans and surfer tees. Some had the tans and the muscles of actual surfers. She noticed Nick Landreu sitting in the back row, gazing out the window. There’s a floater for sure, she figured, and her first target lesson for the others.

“You all got your assignment for the summer reading.”

She went to the board and wrote on it “The Great Gatsby.” Then she turned to the class.

“Nick,” she said. No response. “Nick Landreu.” No response. “Can someone wake him up, please?”

The girl sitting in front of Nick turned and touched his hand. He jerked his head forward.

“Good morning, Nick,” Amanda said coolly.

“Good morning, Ms. Baxter.” A sheepish smile on his face.

“You’re not going try to play Spicoli on me this year, are you Nick?” Every year one or more of the surfers would attempt to fail her class spectacularly, in a manner that approached comedy but rarely arrived.

“Never entered my mind, Ms. Baxter.”

“That’s good, Nick. Would you mind if I asked you a question.”

“It’s your class, Ms. Baxter.”

“Thank you Nick. Actually I want to ask you about another Nick, Nick Carraway, the narrator character in the summer reading you were assigned.”

“OK.”

“What is it about Nick Carraway’s personality that makes him the perfect narrator for this novel?” she asked, expecting a prolonged embarrassed silence in response.

Nick took a breath as though in contemplation and then he replied. “I think Nick is closest to the moral core that Fitzgerald’s own life had lost. Nick is the compass around which the other characters revolve, although he is not completely free from moral failure.”

Amanda took a moment of stunned silence before she replied. “Then you enjoyed reading Gatsby.”

“Very much, although I didn’t understand it until I’d read the rest of Fitzgerald’s work.”

“The rest. You read another of his novels?”

“I read, well, all of them. But I really liked his short stories.”

Amanda sat back against her desk, considering that this might be a new tactic, kind of a reverse Spicoli technique. Very well, she thought. Let’s play this hand out. “Of all the characters in Gatsby, which was your favorite?”

“Well, Nick Carraway is the only character with any movement in his personality; the rest are like a tableau of early 20th century urban upper class society. Gatsby’s just a morality play.”

“I don’t think you can support that claim.” It was not Amanda, but Susan Williams in the front row who turned to Nick in response. “Jay Gatsby faces the failures of his life in his tragic love for Daisy.”

“What about Daisy?” This was Emily Green in the third row. “She marries Tom for his money and barely even notices her own child.”

Dustin Howard, sitting next to Emily, then said, “That’s Fitzgerald’s indictment of old money; they have everything but they lack a connection to the primary facts of living.”

“If Gatsby is a tale of moral decline,” Emily said, “Why would Fitzgerald represent old money in such a bad light?”

“I think it’s really just money that he’s critiquing,” Nick said.

“What about World War I? He’s contrasting the mindless pleasures of the Jazz Age with the brutality of the trenches,” Brian Phillips added.

“Let’s get our focus back on the characters,” Amanda said loudly. She felt like she had died and gone to teacher heaven. Her class was engaged in a discussion of the summer reading. She would not have to pass out the books and have everyone sit at their desks and read this until the bell rang.

“Who hasn’t had a chance to contribute?” A dozen hands sprouted. She could have cried.

“Jose?” She pointed to Jose Pasquarello.

“Fitzgerald has a real problem portraying characters outside of his own upper-class clique. Everyone else is just usable, like furniture.”

“Myrtle and George are instruments for his plot,” Jaime Gonzales agreed. “But then this is really just an extended short story, so you can’t expect that much.”

“Then you didn’t like Gatsby?” Amanda asked, her voice betraying an accusation.

“All that talk about the green light. I mean, what’s that about?” Jaime asked.

“It’s new money chasing old,” Nick said.

“It’s more like Gatsby chasing Daisy’s pussy,” Dustin said. “Sorry.” He looked up at Amanda.

“That’s not a word we use in class.” Amanda said.

She struggled for her next question, but before she could speak Gloria Fernandez offered, “Fitzgerald is a completely overrated author. I don’t see why Ms. Baxter has us starting with Gatsby. Fitzgerald was the darling of a small crowd of New York literary types and got his work published, but you have to look at him as a real lightweight, compared to his contemporaries.”

“I think he compares well with his rival, Hemingway,” Nick said. “At least he never played the ‘self-important author’ card.”

“But what about Langston Hughes and John Dos Passos?” Gloria said. “Real writers tackling dangerous topics.”

“Then you’d need to include Sherwood Anderson and Sinclair Lewis,” Brian said.

“And Hart Crane and William Carlos Williams,” Emily said.

“And T. S. Eliot,” Dustin added.

“Fuck Eliot,” Jaime said. “He was living in England, anyhow.”

“Class!” Amanda said. “Class, please.”

“If you want to get into poets, you’d need to include Pound,” Jose said.

“And Robertson Jeffers out here in California,” Nick added.

“Class,” Amanda pleaded. “Let’s focus on The Great Gatsby. We can discuss the reading list later.”

Brian Phillips raised his hand. She nodded to him.

“The whole idea of modernism was born by the enormous suffering endured in World War I,” Brian said. “But the war seems so out of place in Gatsby. Fitzgerald really doesn’t know what to do with the reality of war.”

“It’s just an excuse to break up Nick and Daisy. But Daisy would never have married Nick,” Emily said.

“She loved herself a lot more than she could any man,” Gloria said.

“And Gatsby loved the idea of money more than any woman,” Roy said.

“Fitzgerald presents all attractive women as inherently selfish,” Nick offered.

“Makes you wonder about his home life,” Susan said, and the class broke into easy laughter, although some of the students sat quietly and looked dazed and uncomfortable. Britany Sloane, one of the girls dressed in Juicy Couture, raised her hand. “This is tenth-grade English. Right? I think I’m in the wrong class.”

“Right class,” Dustin said to her. “Wrong shoes.”

“Bite me.”

“Nice thong.”

“In your lonely pathetic dreams.” She turned away.

The topic had come back around to Gatsby, but as Amanda searched her mind for the right question to bring to this point, Gloria again spoke up.

“I think Dos Passos gives us a much larger perspective on war and the early modernists than Fitzgerald.”

“Dos Passos was a closet conservative, even when he was writing about the Spanish Civil War,” Jose said.

“Still, Manhattan Transfer is a good read,” Nick added.

“Why are we starting with the Jazz Age anyhow? What about the 19th century?” Roy Ochoa offered.

“I’m really in the dark there. I haven’t read anything earlier than Stephen Crane,” Nick said. “What do you recommend?”

Amanda was just going to say “Moby Dick,” when Emily said, “Forget Melville. That’s lesson one.”

“Right,” Brian said. “Moby can suck my...” He laughed and the class echoed this. “I’d start with Twain,” he added.

“James,” Emily said.

“Irving,” Jose said.

“Poe,” Susan suggested.

“Right, Poe,” Dustin said. “Starting with Poe is a good thing.”

“Quoth the Raven...” Roy said.

“Nevermore,” a chorus replied.

“Amanda,” Emily said. “Do you think we should start with Poe’s poetry or his tales? His detective fiction or his science fiction?”

Amanda had backed silently toward the door. The clock was only at half past the hour. From being so very right, things had turned completely wrong. All of the plans she had made for the class had slipped into a crevasse of inappropriateness. The level of discussion had somehow vaulted above her intellectual means. Her breath came staccato as she attempted to stay calm.

“Why not start at the present, say with the current techno avant garde, and work back?” Jaime said. “We have all year; I think we can get through the entire twentieth century this semester, and move back to the previous centuries next semester. We can probably do four or five books a week. My Guide can talk with the rest of yours to set up a schedule.”

“Four or five books a...week?” Panic danced up her legs, and Amanda slid out the door. As it closed, she heard Brian say, “I think the early modernists give us a great platform to look back at the nineteenth century. Amanda must have given it some serious thought. Amanda?”

Amanda fled down the empty corridor, past the students’ lockers and the auditorium, her shoes clattering on the waxed Spanish tiles. She made the turn to the south wing and clutched at the door of the teachers’ lounge. She yanked it open and propelled herself inside. The door shut behind her.

A dozen other teachers stood silently in a variety of states of shock. Their eyes sought out the comfort of their peers but received only surprise and fear in return. Behind her the door was flung open and Gary Trumble, the tenth grade history teacher, stumbled in, breathing heavily.

“They read the Magna Carta,” she heard him say as he fumbled across the room

Her eyes caught a handwritten notice scrawled across the whiteboard behind the coffee maker. “Welcome to the future of education. Emergency teacher’s meeting here at 4 pm Friday.” It was signed Phil Quigley.

Amanda realized to her horror that this was still the first day of class.

Overnight, Don Driscoll used his sysadmin status to run a new set of filters on the Junana.com admin logs and stats. His artificial intelligence algorithm sifted unexpected features, starting with the idea that the most significant outcome is the least common occurrence. The algorithm created a ranking weighted to the least expected events.

Coming into work at eight sharp, he set down his latte and blueberry muffin and fired up the CPU. The encrypted output file was waiting in his admin folder when he logged in. He copied this to the desktop computer and deleted the original. He had truncated the routine after the first 500 least-expected outcomes, but he did not need more than the first page to find what he was looking for.

There it was: Five accounts had been set up to bypass the authentication process. The switch that allowed this to happen was not even available to Don as ROOT, so some super-user level existed that Don knew nothing about. The five accounts had phony names. Don ran a search. Their first names: Oscar, Patty, Rafael, Sandy, and Tony with last names, Woods, Michael, Donald, Garcia, and Scott had been picked out of a combination of unused hurricane designations and professional golfers. Five people were wandering around Junana.com totally incognito. Five people out of more than a billion. Authorized by someone with privileges greater than the sysadmin.

There were some other interesting features on his list of least probable events, so he saved the encrypted file for later, and coded an admin program to track the five users. One of them had to be Scratchy.
