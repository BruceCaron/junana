Game Release + Four Months

Bobby led Megan to an ancient roadhouse, its slate roof laden with moss, its stone walls bleeding mortar like old cheese. Inside, through an enormous oak door, was a dark hall lit by a smoke-spewing fireplace and a few dingy windows. Around them a number of men sat at rough-hewn tables where they gnawed hunks of roasted meat and drank from pewter flagons. Rats scurried about on the floor. The only woman in the place was a scullery maid in a skirt and a flimsy bodice, scrubbing something over in the corner on her hands and knees while she exposed her cleavage.

“I think the rats are a nice, homey touch,” Megan said. “I’m also impressed by the grime. It seems, well, so perfectly grimy.”

“Sit over here by the window,” Bobby gestured to a small oaken table. The barkeeper glanced their way with his one good eye. Bobby shook him off. Megan sat her avatar down on a stool.

“Listen carefully,” Bobby said, gesturing over the tabletop. “This is Level One.” The table suddenly became a kind of map, like the one in the front of The Hobbit book. “You will need to make friends with seven different species in the seven realms....”

“I’m not really that much into this whole fantasy game thing,” she admitted. Bobby held up one hand and continued to explain.

“Each species will challenge you to solve some problem that means ultimate life or death to it.”

“I just opened the door to see what this Game was all about.”

“When you solve the problem you can progress to the next species.”

“Where will you be while I’m solving all these problems?” This was sounding like way too much time, and she had other places to be, like back in Junana with her friends. Only a lot of her friends were not hanging in Junana so much anymore.

“I will be at your side.” He sat back, his face a mask of shock. “Where else would I be? I told you, I am your Guide.”

“Really!” she said, perking up. “So we’ll be together all the time?”

“Together, yes. Every minute in Level One. But you will need to find the answers yourself. I’m only here to lend a hand when things get, well, difficult.”

“In what way?”

“Did I mention that not all of these species are what you might call ‘friendly’?”

“Oh!” It was her avatar’s turn to appear shocked.

“I can teach you how to defend yourself.” His doublet morphed into a suit of chain mail, and a broadsword grew on his belt within an elaborate scabbard.

“I always wanted to shoot a crossbow,” she admitted.

“Just remember that your mission is to make friends, not corpses.” He morphed back into his regular costume.

“Just how different are these species?” she asked.

“Philosophically, they are worlds apart. That’s the real challenge. Biologically...” He shrugged. Then, and rather suddenly, he morphed into a form that resembled something like a cross between a kangaroo and an monitor lizard.

“...there are some noticeable differences here too,” he lisped through a forked tongue and then, just as suddenly, returned to his usual form.

“You are just a Game piece, aren’t you?” she sounded deflated.

“I am your Game piece,” he said. His hands reached out and covered hers. “Yours alone. If you get through this level we will be together for many, many hours in the Game. I hope you come to like me as much as I already like you.”

“That would be the shit,” she said.

He frowned, knurled his brow, and then smiled. “Yes, the total shit. Indeed!”

Scratchy set down the phone and looked away from the computer monitor and out the window of his study, toward the Santa Barbara hills, shrouded in June gloom. On his lap a grey cat purred. Scratchy was researching the history of the Sapphire Children.

In the 1990s, Ralph Lamont, a failed Methodist preacher in Arkansas who had read Constantine’s work, claimed that the template tessellation would be completed only when a new society of “sapphire babies” was born and allowed to grow up with support for their special abilities. A victim of undiagnosed learning disorders, he had recognized in this own son, little Billy Lamont, a special destiny.

According to his father, Billy was the first of a loose network of “sapphire children” who were heralding not just a talent for learning, but the threshold of a new species. Reverend Ralph used template-unfolding ability as a measure of these precocious few. Billy, truth be told, had quite a knack with templates. Templates, the Reverend argued, were too sophisticated for the minds of adults who, anyway, preferred to wallow in cable television melodramas and Internet porn.

The ability to generate the templates was impossible to teach. Some people had a knack while others were quite immune to the process. Sometimes younger children were the most adept in the first stages of the unfolding process, but then had little success completing this. The same child, a decade later, might not retain any vestige of this ability.

Ralph started a school in Emerson, Arkansas, home of the world’s only Purple Hull Pea Festival and World Championship Rotary Tiller Race. Hundreds of families, mostly from the Midwest, enrolled their scions in this establishment, which promised to nurture their sapphire essence for a mere twenty-grand a year plus room and board. Problem was, very few of the sapphire children did very well on their SATs. By the time Billy was old enough to drive, his command of the templates was history, as was the school.

Constantine responded to reporters investigating the sapphire child phenomenon by noting that dozens of templates had already been unfolded by perfectly normal adults. Yet, the popular perception of his work remained ambiguously linked to notions of New Age cults. He returned to landscape architecture and continued to try to systematize the existing templates, without success.

Unfolding a set of templates, Scratchy figured, could begin in one of two completely discrete manners. The first resembled filling in a jigsaw puzzle. The problem space would be determined, and the first, the seed, template would then begin a sequence of solutions that eventually covered the entire space.

Usually the order of the template sequence was important from a practical standpoint. Like making a pizza, the crust has to come before the sauce. Among the eight original templates within the software design problem space, the Controller template had to precede the rest.

The problem spaces Scratchy examined in the template literature seemed nearly random in their distribution: house design, organizational structure, music theory, baseball strategy. Templates had been unfolded in a strange mix of arenas, none of them connected. Scratchy considered a completely new way to unfold a template structure.

The original eight templates in Template Technology had logically implied another layer of seven templates. Scratchy wondered if this pattern would imply more layers. When he discovered another layer of six templates, he kept on going through the remaining five layers until he found a layer with only one template.

What intrigued him was that as the template layers grew, they also become less and less linked to the original problem space. When he discovered the final template, he realized that this might be something like a universal seed. He called this template “Noel.”

“Things get faster now,” Cindy said to Nick today when he logged on. “You are moving beyond physical combat into a mental combat zone.” They were standing on a bluff overlooking a vast, Technicolor desert, with other monoliths shimmering in the distance. Overhead, a hawk circled and cried. Cindy’s hair was blowing in the wind. She wore a short buckskin dress and a beaded belt.

“As long as I can kick your sorry ass again,” Nick said.

“In your dreams, cowboy,” Cindy said. “I’m here to get you up to speed, so don’t let me down. I’ve got my reputation to protect. I’m the best fucking Guide on the block!”

“Bite me!” Nick said.

“Later. Here’s the drill. You will be put into a situation where you can assemble all the information you need in order to ask the one question that sends you to the next sector. The information is gathered though Queries, which are the mental equivalent of me with a BFG fighting you with your Glock. At least that’s what it will seem like at first. If you ask a lame fucking question, and believe me there is such a thing as a stupid question...” She poked his avatar in the forehead with her finger as she spoke, but she was smiling too.

“...I will take you back to the First Level. And you don’t want to go there.”

He nodded his head in agreement. He was eager to move on.

“Hold my hand,” she said. “If I catch you looking up my skirt again I will drop you on your head!”

People would later claim he did so because it was the seed, the birth, of so many templates. Only later he confessed he did so because it was Douglas Adams’ middle name and he discovered this template on Towel Day.

The name “Noel” did not stick. Everyone soon called it “Choose One.” The template seemed simple enough: “When faced with an equilibrium that has more than one possible stable solution, choose one.”

“Choose One” was extremely powerful. It provided a seed for everything from language (connecting sound to meaning) to traffic control (driving on only one side of the road). It also opened up to a constructivist view of society, suggesting that choice was implicit in many arenas, including gender.

Chose One said to the universe, “There are several ways we can go, but we’re all going to agree on this way for now, with the understanding that we can do it some other way later, thank you.” It wasn’t quite as elegant as “42”, but it was close. Once you started unfolding with it, you could never escape the arbitrariness of that first choice.

Scratchy explored the enormous problem arena encompassed by his Noel template seed. Mostly he was concerned that the unfolding process would lead to internally contradictory or simply unsound solutions. What if Noel led to logical but self-defeating answers? Nothing solves world hunger faster than a fatal global pandemic, but you don’t need to go there. And if Noel was going to help make seventeen-year-olds any smarter, than they would need to learn how to work the same logic he used to uncover this template.

After unfolding a dozen or so template systems out of Noel, he realized that template unfolding was still incredibly sensitive to the opening description of the problem space. A highly theoretical space unfolded comically transcendental templates with little purchase on any real problem. “How many angels can dance on the head of a pin?” The templates respond: “That depends on the song.” He hoped Desi and Itchy were having better luck with the template logic for education.

Winston had spent the past two years playing “hide the money.” Mr. Slick taught him how to use one government to help hide information from the next. Winston kept up his usual rounds of global consulting on derivatives and hedge fund growth. He used the travel to carry instruments of value, but of course not actual cash, that spread their combined wealth along a web of shell corporations across four continents. Over the months, these corporations merged and split into new entities, masking their original investments.

Each time he returned to Philly, he’d check in with the Nerds. And every time they talked, Winston was reminded that he didn’t code. All he could do was listen and wonder. He felt like the caterer for Michelangelo at the Sistine Chapel. “Hello, Mr. Simoni, you want me to bring you another latté up there on the scaffold?” Here he was pushing money around while they were forging a new digital planet.

Since the emergency telecon, the Nerds had been exploring Scratchy’s thirty-six templates to great advantage. A single template contained hundreds of lines of precision code. Their combinations allowed for a vast range of interoperable objects. Winston listened in wonderment as the Nerds mined this resource for new miracles.

Scratchy modeled new network architectures, search routines, and the chassis for the massive global mesh computing enterprise. He wove the infrastructure for managing countless users and administrative services.

Itchy rebuilt his graphics engine and autonomous behavior routines, adding new protocols for user interactivity. His avatars developed capacities for learning a wide range of behaviors, and their features gained an entire fractal level of detail. Their faces now had pores like a teenager. He even gave them a touch of acne, which would flare and disappear over a span of months.

“Forget the zits,” Scratchy advised, “only give them a smile that will socket right into the Gamer’s groin.”

Desi ported DocDo to the new system and was rewarded with a hundred-fold increase in speed. He built user profiling support, figuring ways to authenticate users and model their behaviors within the system. He implemented a new encryption scheme with a symmetric 512-bit key. He created hooks into a broad tier of national databases across the globe, from which he could extract information on a third of the planet’s population.

At the same time they were working around the clock to build the system, they were dancing around the lack of a clear purpose to their endeavor. What was all of this technology to be used for? On the open market this suite of new applications would sell for more than they were already worth. But so far they had no idea how their efforts might affect a single seventeen-year-old, not to mention five hundred million of them.

Scratchy figured out how to assemble a copy of the Internet, or rather, those parts that were likely to be useful: several petabytes of text, images, video, and database contents. They leased an exabyte of fast storage from storage brokers across the planet. They queried this stored information from a massively parallel XServe server farm Desi built in Manasagangotri next to the University of Mysore.

Desi wanted to work on the problem of granularity, implicit meaning, and semantic extensions of various modes. He started to break down the whole corpus into molecular units, index these in a variety of meaningful ways, and then run a bank of tests to see if he could automate narrative constructions from the mix. This, he explained to Winston, is about as easy as pulling a whole peach intact out of a blended fruit smoothie.

Desi had good reason to hope. He had unfolded the templates for a type of frame semantics, something he’d picked up while at Berkeley. Frame semantics allowed him to start with any verb in any language, determine the scope of its frames, decide which frame would apply to the sentence at hand, and then, like a crystal in a supersaturated solution, grow meaning and context from the Internet soup of molecular granules. What emerged wasn’t Shaw or even Vonnegut, but it contained credible paragraphs constructed entirely artificially, and in any of the major languages.

When Desi showed this to Itchy, he found out that Itchy had been working on unfolding the templates for dramatic plots, using the collected plays of the American and British stage. It turns out that nearly all of the plots could be generated by a three-level template structure. Fortunately, or rather, fortuitously, since they had really been exploring the same template structure from opposite ends, the top-level templates from Desi’s frame semantics mapped directly into the base level of Itchy’s plot templates. This meant that the granules derived from the Internet could be woven into actual stories.

They demonstrated this to Scratchy by feeding in Macbeth and outputting a simple list of phrases. These phrases were then randomized and fed back into the template structure. What emerged was not Macbeth, but something eerily close to it, as if a version had been written not from memory, but from hearsay. If anything, the plot was too coherent. The templates Itchy had unfolded could not faithfully reproduce ambiguity and irony. Scratchy guessed that the three-layer template structure would need at least a couple more layers before it could pull some convincing Shakespeare from the soup.

Once they could build stories, it was just another few steps to montage in video and photographs, using a combination of audio and graphics interpretation routines. The resulting mini-movies looked like rough cuts of cinema verité student films. Desi sent out some alpha client software and the five of them spent weeks pulling these little movies out from the Internet. Then they had called another teleconference.

“You’re telling me these stories are generated automatically from the questions I’m asking?” Mr. Slick said.

“How ever do you do that?” Winston added.

“Algorithmically, my dear Winston,” said Scratchy.

“At least they’re fast,” Itchy noted. “They will scale up fine. We still don’t have any way of programming a learning path through these events. We need an education specialist. We’re flying blind right now.”

“I know someone,” Winston said. “Haven’t spoken to him in years. MIT, Stanford, and a short time with the NSF before he figured out they didn’t want to listen to him. He went to Brazil where they are researching new forms of teaching. His name is Robby Robinson.”

“Would he move to Japan to work with Ichiro?” Mr. Slick asked.

“Under the right conditions, I’m sure we can convince him,” Winston said.

“I believe we are ready to meet again. You will be contacted about the next location.”

“Nerdfest ho!” Scratchy said. “Adios, amigos. I’ve got iron to lay,” and he hung up.

Desi added, “I feel like laying something too. TTFN.”

“Back to the coal mines,” Itchy said. “You two are lucky you don’t code, or unlucky. This is getting really good! Ciao.”

“The Nerds are on a roll,” Winston said.

“So am I. Code is not the only aspect of this game.”

“Something up your sleeve?”

“Ask me no questions, and...”

“Just a hint...”

“What’s your shoe size? So long, Winston.”

“Goodbye, Jack.”

Winston sat back from his desk. In the years since the first, what did Scratchy just call it? “Nerdfest,” he had been grappling with his responsibility for getting them all involved. He could just as well have left them to enjoy their dot-com fortunes.

The notion of building the first mesh computer had sent them all into full Yippie mode. They had, right in their hands, the equivalent of a digital tsunami event, not just a new computer game, but also a technology that was to current day computers what the computer had been for the adding machine.

“Busy, busy, busy,” he whispered and closed his eyes.

Game Release + Five Months

When Nick took Cindy’s hand they lifted off the bluff and began to fly across the desert at some height. Below them the landscape changed from rock and sand to pine forest and then to firs. Up ahead a spire caught the sunlight, and they approached a town of stone buildings and cobble streets. The town was on a hillside; the buildings nestled into the trees. The stones, the trees, the grass poking through the cracks, even the donkeys braying in the shadows of the stone huts on the edge of town looked too real to be real. The wind would play along the sides of the buildings and flutter the curtains in the open windows. Scores of avatars moved along the streets in pairs. Players and Guides, he guessed.

They landed at the edge of town. She started up the street and turned.

“Come on, big boy!” Her clothing changed into a long flaxen robe with a green belt.

Nick noticed that all the other Guides were in robes. He followed her through the doorway of the first building on the right. The interior was dark and the door closed behind them with a solid thump.

Cindy lit a candle she now held on a brass holder, and Nick was amazed at the quality of the light. The flame flickered and smoked and sent its warm brilliance and shadows across the stone floor to illuminate an oaken table and chair and, curiously, a computer.

“Hey!” He noticed that Cindy’s computer was not just any PC. It was exactly like his gaming machine, even the same monitor.

“Here is where things get interesting,” Cindy said. “Listen up, cowboy.”

She set down the candle and leaned across the table to touch the computer screen. It lit up with the exact image that was on his actual screen. This created that fractal ketchup bottle effect: setting off a thousand images inside of images, diminishing into a point of light. She then looked away from his avatar, out directly at Nick, sitting in front of his computer.

“Hello, Nick,” she said, leaning back against the table, still looking right at him instead of his avatar. “I can’t see you. Turn on your webcam.” He did so.

“Hi, Cindy,” he replied, a bit creeped out. The candlelight caught her from the side, and her profile was dead serious.

“Now is the time,” she continued, “for me to start explaining a few things about the Game. So I want you to listen for about five minutes and then let me know what you think.” She waited. “Nick, you with me?”

“Go ahead.”

“When you first got into the Game, I bet you thought it was just another entertainment on Junana.”

Nick nodded.

“So wrong!” She slapped the table with her hand. His head jerked back in response. “Junana is just the gateway to the Game. Even as the Game is the gateway to your new life.”

“What?” Why was Cindy acting so strange? Even when she was angry with him she never got this serious.

“Shush, now! Listen to me. For years you’ve been playing computer games with some real skill and going to school where you feel empty and bored. You are not alone. I am not going to give you the history of the Game right now; you’ll get that later. I just want to tell you that the Game will teach you everything you would normally learn at school. Only you will want to learn what you learn more than you wanted to do anything before. More than surfing out at the county line, more than Samantha Greenly in fifth grade...,”

How did she know that?

“...more than a kiss from Wanda...”

“I don’t know about that,” Nick said.

“Put a sock on it and listen up! I’m not finished. There are seven levels to the Game that we know about. This is Level Two. Many people never leave this level because they just can’t find the will to give up how they want to think about the world. In this level the Game offers you clues to help you find your way. When you graduate to Level Three, there will be no more clues, but I will be with you still. By the time you finish Level Two, you will know more than enough to graduate from Santa Barbara High School. And you will also know a system you can use to continue learning.

“There is a Zen Buddhist saying: ‘When you reach the top of the mountain, keep climbing.’ That decision will be yours. If you really want to keep climbing, then you will earn your shoes and move on. Otherwise, you will stop playing the Game, and go on with your life out there.

“Take this as the warning label for the Game, Nick. If you go ahead with me and get through these next few levels you will find that the world out there is a different place, simply because you will understand it in a totally different manner.

“The world of the Game is the real world. The content you will face comes from your life, not some fantasy land. The rules of the Game are the rules you will also follow outside the Game. If you go on with the Game, your life will change. That’s for dead certain. They want you to know that. It’s the reason they made the Game. So now you’ve been warned. Now you can ask your questions.”

Cindy waited while Nick assembled his thoughts.

“What do mean there are seven levels ‘that you know about’?”

“Good. You were listening. The Game has been programmed through the unfolding of a series of learning templates. The entire series is not yet unfolded, and so we do not know where the final levels of the Game will take us. Perhaps the seven levels are as deep as humans can understand themselves and the world. Maybe you will be the person who can unfold level eight. We just do not know.”

“You mentioned ‘shoes’. What’s that about?”

“When you graduate from a level you earn something you can wear. You can wear it in Junana and you will be sent the article to wear out there.” Cindy waved her hand as if gesturing at Nick’s room.

“Can you enter my world?”

“Don’t be an idiot, I’m all pixels here.” Cindy smiled. “I do know a lot about your world. I’ve got your grade reports for the past ten years, and your police report from those jeans you boosted in seventh grade.”

“Woah!” Nick covered his face with his hands.

“Nicky. I don’t care that you got caught shoplifting. You and me, we’ve already had some great times together, and better times to come. Only now we do it with the rules of your world. You want to quit. Fine. Go with my blessing. You want to stay, just know the Game is real. So you’re going to need to buckle down and buckle up too.”
