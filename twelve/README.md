# Section Two: Nerdville  Twelve
On the occasion of the release of the Game on Junana, Jack arranged for the Nerds to gather on his yacht, le Grand Azure, moored in Barbados. One by one they were greeted at the airport and taken by car to a small boat that carried them out to the enormous yacht, anchored like its own island off the breakwater in Speightstown. Desi and Itchy had the worst jet-lag, having traveled in opposite directions around the globe from Vietnam, Itchy through Vancouver and Desi through Dublin.

Jack played host for the first two days, not allowing any business to take place while pampering them with whirlpool baths, massages, and banquets. Scratchy spent the afternoons in the day salon watching Jack’s sci-fi DVD collection on a huge flat screen. The ship’s cat, a huge black manx Jack named Starbuck, took to curling up on Scratchy’s ample lap. Jack was in Barbados ostensibly for a Wharton conference on global trade, so he flew over to Bridgetown in his helicopter each morning.

On the third day, after lunch on deck, Itchy, Scratchy, and Desi were about ready to steal the launch and head for Holetown when the helicopter returned and landed on the fantail. Jack emerged with another man.

“Is that Winston?” Desi asked, jumping up. “It is!”

Desi scampered down the stairway with Scratchy and Itchy stumbling behind him. He threw up his arms and gave Winston a greeting hug.

“Ricky!” he sang out. “Is that really you?”

“Hello Lucy,” Winston returned the hug. He nodded at Scratchy and Itchy. “How long has it been? Seven years?”

“I’m glad it’s almost over,” Desi said. “This has to be the longest joke ever. How ever did you get Count Slick to let you through security?”

“I’m speaking at the Wharton conference. Naturally he invited me to his yacht.”

“So this was all planned in advance. Thank you, Jack.” Desi gave him a tight hug that almost lifted him off the deck. Jack waved his arms helplessly and then patted Desi’s shoulders in return.

“I thought we’d all like to be here for the big day.”

They returned to the covered on-deck dining suite. Winston chatted with the other Nerds while Jack arranged for drinks all around. Jack settled at the head of the table and pulled back from the chatter. Starbuck strolled under the table and jumped up on Jack’s lap.

Itchy and Desi were telling Winston and Scratchy about life in Sao Do and the beta testing they’d been doing on the Game. Desi had advanced quite far into the Game play, and was thrilled with the results. Itchy raved about the speed-reading routines that suddenly began to work once the players had internalized the brainwave techniques. He claimed to have read the entire System of the World in one day.

“And it was still too long,” Scratchy said.

Their conversation rolled through current topics on technology and politics. Jack sipped at his beer as the yacht shifted slightly at its anchor. The success of the Junana social networking service had opened up Jack’s eyes to the possibility that their scheme might prove much more than a simple jolt to the world system. Starbuck purred under his hand.

Winston kept glancing around the table. Everything had turned out so very much more fascinating than he had imagined. More troublesome, more portentous. They were on the verge of launching an entire new technology layer, designed to penetrate and remold the logic of everyday life. The Game was far more powerful than any joke. Pandora, he mused, might have had this same delicious moment of introspection.

“Gentlemen.” Jack raised his beer. The others quieted and lifted their glasses. “None like us, more like us.”

“Hear, hear!” Scratchy said. “In the immortal words of Gary Gilmore, ‘Let’s do it.’”

Jack set Starbuck on the teak deck. “Follow me.”

They went down to the boardroom where a computer projector showed the screen of a laptop.

“I think Michael should have the honors,” Desi said.

“Or he’d take them anyhow,” Itchy said.

“Would not,” Scratchy insisted. “Let’s give Jack the privilege. It was his idea in the first place.”

“I don’t know exactly what to do,” Jack said.

“Here.” Scratchy pulled up the Total Eclipse IDE. The code that opened up Game door user interface in Junana and the download of the Junana client with the Game interface had been committed but not implemented on the public server. Scratchy menued to the interface, selected the code for implementation, and positioned the cursor over the button.

“Push the mouse button, and we are in the Game business.”

“Go ahead,” Winston said. “The Game’s afoot!”

The Nerds watched the screen as Jack moved up and clicked on the mouse.

“Boom!” Scratchy said. “There goes daytime TV.”

“Kazing!” Itchy said. “So long fashionistas.”

“Braaaack!” Desi said. “There goes high school.”

“Pow!” Winston said. “No more paparazzi.”

They turned to Jack.

“Bada-bing!” Jack said, hesitating. “Good bye, Madison Avenue.”

“And Ginza,” said Itchy.

“And Rodeo Drive,” said Winston.

“And Connaught Place,” said Desi.

“Right on!” Scratchy added. “Now can we please get off this fucking boat?”

§ § §

Don Driscoll’s weekly report to Scratchy did not seem to upset him in the least. The numbers of users in Junana were still rising, but the interaction time load had plummeted. It was like hundreds of millions of users were logging in and then disappeared without logging off. In fact, the mean logged-on time had jumped. Are they going to sleep? Are they listening to music? Why log on and do nothing? And why did Scratchy just nod and smile when Don pointed this out to him? And what’s so special about Junana anyhow?

Until Don got his bioform completed he could not even chat on Junana.com, an arrangement he considered ironic, since his job was to run the damn software. He was certain his former co-workers at Cal State Chico were blackballing him from the site. His profile remained marked with a “Sincerity Alert.”

Feeling compelled to look around inside the software as a user, Don humbled himself and rewrote his bioform in one excruciating afternoon. He confessed how angry he had been when WeBWillacker went bust in 2000 and cost him $27 million in stock options. He remembered a time when he had hobbies and inserted these. He used to ride a motorcycle. He used to play ultimate Frisbee.

By the end of the afternoon, he had to shut and lock his office door; he had taken to blubbering while he typed. He put in the names of friends he remembered from Bell Labs and from the University of Illinois. Hell, he put in the name of the dog he had in grade school, good old Trouble, who never was any. Then, before he lost his nerve, he pushed ‘SUBMIT’ and waited. A short while later, maybe fifteen minutes, a pop-up window appeared with a message.

“Dear Don,

We at Junana.com want to congratulate you on what you have accomplished by completing your bioform. You are among the three percent of Sincerity Alerted users who have found the personal wherewithal to fix their profile. We hope you find your time on Junana.com to be rewarding, and we look forward to your presence on the Plazas.

By the way, your friend Dick McGovern from your freshman year at Illinois has been eager to meet with you. We’ve added his username to your friends list. He likes to hang out at the Illinois ‘76 plaza. Feel free to download the Junana client software for your computer and check out the Game while you’re logged in.

Again, welcome to Junana.com!

Junana”

Don had not thought about Dick McGovern for thirty years or more. They used to code together on the CDC 7600. So many late nights, so much coffee. This was well before anybody had heard of a cappuccino. Don sat back in his desk and looked out the window across Hollister avenue. He had just realized why Junana.com was so very popular, so important to so many people, and why it scared the living bejeebees out of so many others.

Before Junana.com, at least if you lived in the U.S., your life was a serial sitcom of discrete periods: childhood, high school, college, workplace, move to a new town, then a new job, a new husband or wife, a new divorce, another new town, and on and on, always abandoning the past. Sometimes you were outright fleeing from the past; and, in any case, burying this behind you.

Folks like Don, who had a habit of burning their bridges whenever they left a town, created a disconnected cohort of people—ex-friends, ex-coworkers, ex-spouses—whose last impression of them was: “What a fucking asshole.” Folks like Don were wise to keep a list of these ex-people, better to avoid them in the future. Every great once in a while, Don would run into someone on the list and pretend he never met him. But on Junana the entire list was waiting to approve of his resume. In a flash all those burned bridges were intact. His past was now surgically reattached to his ass.

There were also plenty of people who left town on Don; they were on the list of people he considered to be idiots or bastards. Shouldn’t he have the same opportunity to screw with their future? He thought for a minute: what about Steve Post? Steve Post spent two years trying to steal Don’s job as CIO at WeBWillacker. The guy never smiled, and he finally left when everyone up the ladder from him in the company concluded he was a complete pain in the ass. Of course, there were several hundred “Steven Post” listings on Junana, but only one with a link to WeBWillacker.

Don clicked on the name and the all-too-familiar bioform came up. Don was hoping to find enough humiliating information to drop old Steve a note, congratulating him on the dismal failure that would certainly be Steve’s life. As he read, he discovered that Steve’s first wife had died just before he joined WeBWillacker. She had been diagnosed as bipolar and killed herself and their two kids by driving off the road near Los Gatos. After WeBWillacker, Steve went back to school, did a medical degree and became a psychiatrist in New Mexico, where he also did research on bipolar disorder and later remarried. Now he is a prominent fixture of the medical community in Albuquerque.

Don logged out of Junana.com. All those days Steve volunteered to stay late and work. The fierce devotion he put into his programming. Steve never had a good word for anyone, moping around the water cooler. When they ordered in pizza, he just took his slices back to his cube. The dude lived in his cube. Don thought he was after his job, but Steve was trying to avoid going home to that sad empty house. If Steve hadn’t been staying late all those nights, Don could have gone home. How many days he cursed Steve for sucking up to the management. Why didn’t Steve tell anyone? Why didn’t they know? It was a good crowd at WebWillacker. They could have helped. Might have saved Don’s marriage, too, if he spent more time with the kids.

“This thing is going to be worth trillions!” Don whispered, doing the math. A billion users on Junana, eventually paying ninety-nine Dollars, or Euros, or Pounds, or whatever, every month. The biggest bargain of their lives, and a bonanza for Michael ‘Scratchy’ fucking O’hara.

The idea of Haverbrook School was conceived the day, perhaps the instant, when little Simon Bishop failed entry into the elite Orange County kindergarten that the Reverend had always planned as the launching pad for the twins’ academic enterprise.

The Ultra-Conservative Congregationalist Convention sought and bought a North Carolina property from the Unitarians as a campus for Haverbrook. North Carolina, Reverend Gerry Bishop believed, was appropriately removed from the cultural decay of New York and Los Angeles. The original gothic mansion had been built in 1879 by Lucas Smedley from the profits on his improved eccentric wheel design, used extensively in locomotives and other steam devices. None of the devices that relied on his design were any more eccentric than was Lucas.

Nowhere near as large as the Vanderbilt’s nearby estate, the Smedley House was serially famous in North Carolina for the occult practices of its original owner, the artistic extravagance of his daughters, the sadistic predilections of his namesake grandson, and then a defensible patricide, a public trial, and the discovery of three bodies buried in the conservatory. The remaining heir gave the property, the house and its eighty acres, to the Unitarians in 1956. The Unitarians ran this as a retreat center, but they barely managed the upkeep and were delighted when the UCCC offered them cash.

The church renovated the main house and built several new structures: classrooms, a dormitory, a gymnasium, a stable for pupils who brought their own ponies, and a chapel in New England style. Its eighty boys, from grades seven to twelve, would be hand picked from the cream of the congregation. Its tuition rivaled an Ivy League college. The curriculum was scrupulously vetted for a puritanical taste. One of the parents donated a science center, complete with a broadband Internet connection and a microcomputer laboratory. None of the faculty imagined they had just admitted the Devil as a new professor.

That is exactly what Reverend Bishop told them when Simon and Peter were enrolled, by which time the broadband network had been extended to every room on the campus and used by every student and teacher for several hours on any given day.

“Why did we build a school way out here? So we could chat with Greenwich Village? ‘Be not deceived, evil communications corrupt good manners.’ First Corinthians.”

Bishop barely listened as the rector explained about their severe Internet filters and the learning management system they relied upon. Bishop left them with a warning to be vigilant, which they were, to an extreme, until the Game slid past all of their electronic defenses as easily as Gargantua might penetrate Panurge’s contrapunctum-covered walls.

The Game rarely had any difficulty fulfilling the fantasies of 14-year-olds, most of whom had already spent a year on Junana.com spelling these out in graphic detail on their bioforms. Many of them were fixated on fictional characters, pirates or wizards from books or the cinema.

“A million Gandolfs can’t be wrong,” Itchy said.

“How about a million Snapes?” Scratchy said. “Almost a third of the little biters go for the dark side.”

“Feel the force,” Winston added.

Other young teens were entering their puppy-love phase, equally fantastic. The objects of their obsession were easily captured by the Game’s algorithms. Some preferred mythical creatures or animated objects that were beyond the scope of the Game’s early design: talking lions and such. Others chose deities, an arena that Scratchy had argued was not one the Game should embrace. Nearly all were ecstatically happy when they opened the door to the Game and their Guide announced herself.

§ § §

“The Game is going to hit high schools worldwide like an EF5 tornado,” Robby said, slurping his pho. “It’s likely to do more damage than good if we don’t give teachers something concrete to work with.”

The Sao Do compound rang with the voices of children at lunch. Robby, Itchy, and Desi had a corner table, where the owner eyed them carefully, personally filling their water glasses, reveling in Desi’s compliments on the food. The restaurants had taken on the challenge of creating a vegetarian pho, not an easy task, as the dish normally is based on a broth of oxtail and beef stock and served with tripe or tendon, as well as bits of heart and liver and chunks of steak or chicken.

Desi was vegetarian by birth, habit, and aesthetic choice. He refused to get into arguments over the moral grounds for vegetarianism, as these tended to offend his omnivorous friends. Scratchy once told him he should go ahead and admit he considered himself better than non-vegetarians. If Scratchy were to apply Intention-full to this problem, Desi mused, he would see it was more an issue of living mindfully. With Desi’s coaxing, the cooks at Sao Do competed to bring to life the essence of pho using only spices and a broth of celery and shallots.

“You are suggesting what?” Itchy knew from Robby’s voice that he had already formulated a plan.

“Even at really small schools, I would imagine that at least three of four teachers will also be Gamers. We can reach them through their Guides. We can give them the tools to use the Game in their classes and to demonstrate to others that the Game is not a threat, but a powerful learning engine for their students.”

“Jack has requested that we incorporate some practical information within the Game. So far we’ve added templates for accounting theory, stock market dynamics, business communication, and statistics into the Free-for-All directory. Players continue to suggest other templates as well. The Guides suggest topics based on the user’s job profile. I don’t see why we couldn’t do something like a teacher in-service class. Can you develop the content?” Desi asked. Robby nodded.

“How about a special high-school teacher scene in Junana for teacher Gamers who have earned their shoes?” Itchy suggested.

“We should have a site outside of Junana where we can provide educational white papers, power-points, and links,” Robby said. “Not everyone is in Junana.”

“We don’t host content outside Junana,” Itchy said, “but we can provide content that teachers can export to their websites and blogs.”

“In a decade there might not be high school as we know it today, nor college for that matter. Tens of millions of teachers across the planet are going to wake up suddenly to the realization that the Game does a much better job covering content then they ever could,” Robby noted.

“Teachers can use the Game to their advantage.” Itchy said.

“Or perceive it as an enormous threat,” Robby said. “Whenever high school entrance or graduation requires standard testing we see this same mistaken obsession with content. Content is actually the easy part, and Game does this incredibly well. Real teaching isn’t about content, it’s about context. It’s about curiosity and conversation. When students already control the content, then the real job of teaching comes to the foreground.”

“What are Gamers supposed to do in a classroom?” Desi asked.

“Schools are extremely valuable as social centers...” Robby said.

“Since when? My high school was more like a social waterboarding marathon,” Desi said.

“I’m not saying it’s always pleasant,” Robby noted. “But it is essential for their social growth. The Game should work with them to make sure Gamers do not become isolated and antisocial. We are creating a cohort of fifteen-year olds with the equivalent of a college graduate degree. There’s no high school in the world today that can handle these kids.”

“Maybe they should be in college,” Itchy said.

“At fifteen they still have attachments to their parents and to peers that are entirely adolescent. What they need is a club where they can work out, express themselves, explore relationships, get into conflicts where the consequences are bounded. They need to do kid stuff. In Spanish they say it this way: ‘el que más temprano se moja, más tiempo tiene para secarse’...”

“’...The earlier you get wet, the more time you have to dry,’ Desi translated. “Oh, I like that.”

“At age fifteen, school should be the place you go to get wet without the possibility of drowning.”

“Like a fight club,” Itchy said.

“Or a love hotel,” Desi added.

“Or like an Outward Bound course, challenging them physically, emotionally, intellectually. Give them Shakespeare to act in, not just memorize. Do the sports and the dances, and use classroom time to push the content to reveal its multi-vocal contexts within the lives of the students.”

“Classes become more like debates,” Itchy said, tilting back his bowl to get to the last noodle.

“College becomes graduate school. Those that choose to go on are those with the motivation to contribute something at that level.” Desi settled back in his chair. The restaurant owner rushed up and put a small bowl of sweet rice chè down in front of him. Desi thanked the man, who bowed and retreated.

“Sounds like high schools will feel the primary impact,” Itchy said. “How many teachers out there are prepared to step up as the adults in a room with thirty adolescent Gamers? How many have the social skills to lead this Outward Bound adventure. That’s asking a whole lot without giving them any training.”

“Some of the teachers will not be able to make the adjustment. And a whole lot of students are not going to like hanging out in a class where they are being taught content they already control. I foresee at least three years of chaos before things settle down. That’s why we need to push schools into a positive path forward. We can expect a huge wave of panic among teachers. Let’s turn this panic into opportunity.”

“We’ll get the Nerds together on this immediately,” Desi said. “When can you start creating the materials?”

“Most of them are ready now,” Robby said. “Ever since we finished the Brainwave bench tests, I haven’t had a lot to do here. One more suggestion.”

“Yes?” Desi said.

“Principals are the key. Can Junana create a space just for high-school principals and headmasters, and invite them to gather for information sessions?”

“I can put a crew on it this afternoon,” Itchy said. “Feeling better?”

“I can’t wait until next September,” Robby said. “I feel like a kid again.”

“That was before kids had their M.A. at age fifteen,” Desi said. “None of us will know what these Gamer kids feel like. That’s the scary part for me. We are creating a new generation that is as different from us as we are from, say, pre-literate societies.”

“Once the teachers are Gamers, a lot of this will get simpler,” Itchy said.

“That’s after it gets so much more complex,” Robby said.

“Busy, busy, busy,” Itchy said.

“Ramen!” Desi added and slurped the last of his pho. “Robby, you should get back to the U.S. to coordinate this effort. We’ll keep you on the payroll and get you settled.”

“How about Stanford?” Robby asked.

Desi nodded his agreement.

“For ten years, colleges have been grousing about getting freshmen who can’t read. Now we’ll give them freshman with master’s degrees,” Itchy said. “Stanford might be a good test bed for studying this.”

Within days of his first plunge into the sectors of Level One, Peter Bishop was fully devoted to Courtney, his Guide. She had, well, everything he imagined she could. That smile, the hair, worn long and supple, the way she talked to him, her eyes, and her body. Her body most of all. She must be at least sixteen, the way she packs the skin-tight leather bodice when she’s ready to fight with him, which was pretty much any time. Apart from Miss Jeffreys, who taught French, Courtney was the only female with whom Peter had contact on a regular basis. The school was allowed afternoons in Asheville twice a week for shopping, but they had to wear their uniforms, so they looked like Dorks from Planet Pilgrim.

The hours he spent in class or in chapel, hours away from Courtney, were a torture to him. She scolded him when he skipped class to log on. Evenings and weekends, she insisted, until the summer, when they can play all day.

“No!” he’d plead, “five more minutes.” With a wave, she would shut down the program until the evening.

Peter’s twin brother, Simon, had other feelings for his Guide. Eldrick the Dark Mage was not a wizard to be trifled with. Eldrick had promised to reveal the arcane knowledge that only the few might attain. Easily displeased, Eldrick challenged Simon to show he was worthy of this knowledge, and Simon vowed, as deeply as he might from the still shallow recesses of his fourteen-year old soul, that he would keep eternal faith with the Dark Mage.

Jennifer and her Con|Int staff were still trying to characterize the various scenes in the Junana social networking service when she noticed the Game. A simple room with a door from every scene in Junana. Not much of a video game player herself, as she had plenty of other distractions, she casually checked out the opening of the Game, and found herself unwilling to commit the days it would take to get through even the first level, although she found her Guide to be attractive in so many ways.

A new high-res Junana.com interface was made available through a downloadable Game client. She figured most of Junana’s users would be switching to this Game client software and out of the browser. Whoever designed this now had hundreds of millions of simultaneous users on software they controlled. She had assigned two of her staff to pursue the Game and report back. Shortly after that, they had each stopped replying to her emails and phone calls.

§ § §

Only months after its initial release, the Game on Junana made the covers of several national and international weeklies. The Chronicle of Higher Education’s cover showed a picture of a seventeen year-old girl in a Yanagi U. hoodie holding up her Y.U. diploma. Inside, it asked the question university presidents were ducking: Is college obsolete? Other stories warned about the lack of control over the content.

“My fifteen-year old son knows more about Marx than most of my graduate students,” a professor of political science at Columbia University announced.

The secrecy behind Junana struck a chord with the weeklies. A list of private European corporations could be identified as managing various aspects of the software giant, but the identities of the owners were left to speculation. Rumors tied Junana to Redmond or Mountain View, or to some unholy alliance of both. Others claimed links to Shanghai or Dubai. Reports on the technology of the Junana client and the Game surfaced in the geek blogs. These were translated for the general public in the mainstream magazines.

Some of the magazines, their writers deep into the Game, carried feature stories about the templates, including interviews with Emil Constantine, now retired and living in Berkeley. Several magazines ran stories about remote villages in India or Zambia, anywhere obscure, with photographs showing teenagers wearing the shoes, holding up their diplomas.

Radio talk shows picked up on the mystery over the ownership of Junana, fanning speculation about sinister intent. Call-in shows were inundated by callers who claimed they’d never played the Game but had heard all about how it was teaching feminism, or socialism, or both. Gamers who called in mostly floundered while trying to describe their experience and invariably told the host to go play the Game.

Reverend Gerald Bishop was at the top of his form. He stood on the broad carpeted plinth in full robes. His eyes took in the vast hall, where 7000 worshippers were standing. With the help of a full orchestra, a choir that would blow away the Mormons, and the biggest pipe organ made in fifty years, they sang out “What a Friend We Have in Jesus.”

Nothing in the building worked as well as the acoustics, which were designed to minimize the lag between the choir and back of the room. This required a bank of speakers at the rear to reflect the choir back to the center of the space. Twenty feet above the crowd, the organ reached the volume of a private jet on takeoff. Most of the room felt like the front row at a ZZ Top concert. That was, of course, the point. Shake them out of their complacency, rouse them from their lethargy, rattle the sin right out of them.

The words of the song were scrolling on the giant screens above him, while the choir leader in a bright blue robe jived like Cab Calloway to the upbeat music. The choir swung back and forth to his direction.

Ever since he took a small church in a remote Texas town out of the Conservative Congregationalist Assembly of God and founded the Ultra-Conservative Congregationalist Convention, Pastor Gerry Bishop had been hoping to lead his new church on a crusade that would redefine the role of religion in the lives of all Americans. Today, his Irvine, California mega-church, more than 20,000 strong along with his nation-wide television audience, was eager to follow his lead. Affiliate congregations in a hundred cities and towns would do likewise. Other churches, ashamed of their lack of foresight, would rally to his cause, and fall in behind him. Within months he would take his crusade to Congress, where the majority he helped put into office will put the force of law behind this effort.

Today he would unleash this army of righteousness upon the greatest threat faced by any American public. The threat was greater than Godless communism; greater than fanatic terrorism; greater than gambling, drugs, and teen sex combined; this digital devil was, of course, online social spaces and games.

“Thou wilt find a solace there...” The last refrain of the old hymn died away in a flourish from the organ and the Reverend Bishop stepped up to his crystal pulpit, into the spotlights of the TV cameras. In his right hand was the white leather-bound Bible he carried for his sermons; in his left, he held a selection of DVD-ROMs from the computer games that were poisoning the minds and the bodies of an entire generation.

Jack and Winston argued for weeks before deciding that Winston should write a series of articles outlining the features of the economy Junana and the Game were reshaping. Jack’s usual concern about security gave way to Winston’s perspective that the impacts of the Game were potentially more fundamental than they previously anticipated. Creating an economy where the consumer was fully individuated would require rethinking most of the theories of consumer behavior and corporate planning. The sooner this process was seeded into the most innovative companies, the quicker their competitive advantages would emerge.

There were always a few multinational corporations eager to build products for discerning customers. Most of these were design firms working in the higher value sectors of their market. Historical precedents were easy to find: Swedish stereos, German sports cars, Italian footwear. Only now this penchant for individuated style and quality would need to be produced for much larger population, allowing prices to drop significantly. Similar continental shifts in advertising and retail marketing would also be required as consumer expectations rose. In many nations, starting with the U.S., the electoral process had also been penetrated by mass-market strategies. Candidates were marketed like Wonderbras. All that would also change.

Perhaps the largest change, and something none of the Nerds had envisioned, was a growing failure in predictability. The emergence of the individual Game player was a side effect of the relationship between each player and her Guide. The logic of the Game required each player to choose her own path through the levels. The Guides had personalities programmed to emerge as they learned from the player’s gaming choices in Level One. There were no cheats, no secrets to be had through the Game magazines or websites.

Winston reminded Jack of what Scratchy had said all those years ago: “‘We can sharpen the tools people use, but it would be better to sharpen the people.’ Well, the people are already sharper,” Winston argued.

“We’re not seeing them any happier,” Desi cut in. “We’ve opened up a lot of windows people tried to keep closed. I’m really worried that the Game doesn’t prepare them for their new perspectives.”

“Desi’s right. There are many consequences the world might need to consider sooner rather than later,” Winston continued. “All I want to do is seed some helpful ideas so that people will grow them.”

“Why not build these ideas into Level Four and let the CEOs who play the Game discover them there,” Jack said.

“It’s not in their workflow to play games,” Scratchy said. “They’re more concerned about how many of their employees are playing the Game. They don’t realize that by the time their employees hit Level Four they have joined an entirely new workforce.”

“How is that?” Winston asked.

“You now have janitors with the equivalent of a graduate degree. How are workers going to keep building widgets and turning burgers once they’ve seen the larger picture?”

“Still another reason to start feeding ideas into the system,” Winston argued. “What happens when your employees know more than you do?”

“What if your caddie were a better golfer than you?” Jack replied, his avatar grinning automatically.

“Or your opponent had better clubs,” Desi said.

“Or a better ball,” Itchy said.

“Or better balls,” Scratchy growled.

“Exactly,” Winston replied. “Least we can do is pave the road ahead for those who have the balls to take it.”
